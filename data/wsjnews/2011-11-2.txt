  Shooting for the Stars

Elon Musk whipped into work this morn-ing in a cherry-red sports car and now he's lounging in his cubicle in a blue T-shirt and jeans talking about protecting humanity by colonizing Mars and making us a multiplanetary species.
He sounds ridiculous.
The entrance to his office building is sleek white minimalist—"Iron Man" come to life. But walk through the huge glass doors and you enter a place where a boy's comic-book dreams meet reality. It's one thing to imagine a spaceship, another to see, a few steps away from Musk's desk, the Dragon capsule scorched from its fiery descent from space. His company, SpaceX, built the Dragon and it blasted off on its first try in December 2010, orbited the earth and plopped down into the Pacific Ocean, and now here it is.
Around the Dragon, in this cavernous former Boeing 747 factory in Hawthorne, California, 1,500 young engineers and techs are building four more Falcon 9s. Musk has contracts for over 30 more launches worth $3 billion—including $1.6 billion from NASA. If all goes according to plan, in late December his third F9 launch will dock with the International Space Station. This 40-year-old is dreaming the stuff of nations.
And that sports car? It's a Tesla and he's the company's CEO and co-founder. It's electric, goes from zero to 60 mph in a neck-snapping 3.7 seconds, travels 245 miles on a single charge and there are now 1,850 of them silently cruising the streets. Next summer his new version, an all-electric sedan that seats seven, should hit showrooms. For extra credit, Musk is also the largest investor and chairman of SolarCity, a solar-panel provider.
Elon Musk doesn't do anything small. In explaining the goals of his companies, he says, "Tesla and SolarCity are about trying to solve the world's most important terrestrial problem, which is sustainable energy, and SpaceX is solving the problem of the millennium, which is making life multiplanetary."
A native of South Africa, Musk graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with degrees in business and physics and then enrolled in a doctorate program at Stanford in applied materials science. Two days later he dropped out and, with his brother, created a software company called Zip2, which was later sold to Compaq, a $300 million transaction that made him rich. Instead of sunning on a yacht off the south of France for the rest of his life, however, he decided to try to save the world.
When he heard that NASA had no plans to send astronauts to Mars, it boggled his mind. The financial problem seemed straightforward, if not simple: Existing rockets employed old technology, used once. "Imagine," he says, "if you built a new 747 for every flight."
Musk launched SpaceX in 2002 and built and designed his own engines from scratch. "I'm head engineer and chief designer as well as CEO, so I don't have to cave to some money guy," he says. He launched his rocket with a team of eight in the control room, instead of dozens. The result: He's offering to send a 10,000-pound payload to geosynchronous orbit for $60 million (compared to an industry standard many tens of millions higher). And if he can figure out how to recover the first stage of his F9, he'll have done what no one has ever done before—created a fully reusable rocket which costs only $200,000 per flight for propellant. "Humanity will be confined to Earth unless someone invents a reusable rocket," he says. "That is the pivotal innovation to make life multiplanetary. I've been pacing around the house at 3 a.m. trying to figure out how to make the F9 reusable," he adds, pacing around his cube. "And I think I have."
Musk isn't the only rich guy gazing at the stars. There's also Richard Branson—but his vehicle travels a mere 62 miles high and doesn't go orbital. There's Amazon's Jeff Bezos—but his secretive company's first small prototype blew up in early September. And there's a slew of others, including United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin—but they use updated versions of Atlas and Delta rockets, old-tech workhorses that aren't going to change anything. Of all the new companies trying to develop rockets, Musk alone has lofted a wholly new one into orbit.
As for electric cars, the biggest auto companies in the world remain miles behind Tesla's performance: The Chevrolet Volt travels all of 35 miles by battery power before a gasoline-fueled generator kicks in. Tesla's forthcoming sedan, with no internal combustion engine, will get you 160 to 300 miles, depending on the battery pack you buy. Last year Toyota invested $50 million in Tesla, which purchased an old Toyota-GM plant in Fremont, California, to begin manufacturing its next model.
To put it simply, Musk is dreaming bigger and further into the future than anyone else out there, and he's putting his money where his mouth is. Just three years ago his first three rockets had failed and Tesla was nearly bankrupt. Instead of retrenching, he fired Tesla's CEO, took on the role himself and poured his remaining cash—some $75 million in all—into the company. Today SpaceX is profitable, and SolarCity, he says, is "cash positive." (He says Tesla will be too, once the new model is out.)
Musk's grandest dream is to make a trip to Mars cost "about as much as a middle-class house in California." Then, he says excitedly, we can begin terraforming Mars. "It would be the most difficult thing humanity has ever done, but also the most interesting and inspiring. Do you want a future where you're confined or reaching toward the stars? I can't wait to go."

  The Corporate Welfare State

    A cause to unite the tea party and the Occupy Wall Street crowd.

The Occupy Wall Street protesters aren't good at articulating what they want, but one of their demands is "end corporate welfare." Well, welcome aboard. Some of us have been fighting crony capitalism for decades, and it's good to have new allies if liberals have awakened to the dangers of the corporate welfare state.
Corporate welfare is the offer of special favors—cash grants, loans, guarantees, bailouts and special tax breaks—to specific industries or firms. The government doesn't track the overall cost of these programs, but in 2008 the Cato Institute made an attempt and came up with $92 billion for fiscal 2006, which is more than the U.S. government spends on homeland security.
That annual cost may have doubled to $200 billion in this new era of industry bailouts and subsidies. According to the House Budget Committee, the 2009 stimulus bill alone contained more than $80 billion in "clean energy" subsidies, and tens of billions more went for the auto bailout and cash for clunkers, as well as aid for the mortgage industry through programs to refinance or buy up toxic loans.
This industrial policy model of government as a financial partner with business can sound appealing, but the government's record in picking winners and losers has been dreadful. Some of the most expensive flops include the Supersonic Transport plane of the mid-1970s, Jimmy Carter's $2 billion Synthetic Fuels Corporation (the precursor to clean energy), Amtrak, which hasn't turned a profit in four decades, and the most expensive public-private partnership debacle of all time, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have lost $142 billion of taxpayer money. A few other illustrative industry handouts:
•The ethanol subsidy, benefitting mostly corn farmers and corporate fuel blenders in the Midwest, costs about $6 billion a year through an array of tax subsidies, tariffs and mandates while making fuel and food more expensive.
• The Federal Communications Commission recently approved spending up to $4.5 billion a year on a Universal Service Fund to bring broadband development to rural America. Broadband service is already rapidly expanding (with some $65 billion in private capital) absent the subsidies, but Internet providers and telecom firms pressed for the program. This is in addition to a $5 billion Broadband Technology Opportunities Program run by the Commerce Department.
• The Department of Agriculture's Market Access Program helps advertise and promote the products of agribusinesses like the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council and Sunkist, the orange growers consortium that has received more than $800 million in the life of the program.
• Crop price supports for wheat, corn, rice, sugar and soybean farmers are supposed to help struggling family farms, but at least half the subsidies go to large and wealthy farmers and corporations. Congress can't seem to wean the farm belt off these payments even though commodity prices and farm incomes are near an all-time high. Restricting those funds to farmers with incomes below $250,000 would save $30 billion over the next decade.
• Some $8 billion has gone via Mr. Obama's Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program to the likes of Nissan, Ford and Tesla Motors for more fuel-efficient cars. Another $2.4 billion has been routed to manufacturers trying to build battery-operated electric cars. As with the loan guarantees to Solyndra, if these companies succeed, the private investors get rich. If they fail, taxpayers lose.
According to the Pew Charitable Trusts's Subsidyscope data base, direct expenditures in the energy industry more than quadrupled in Mr. Obama's first year in office to $18 billion from less than $4 billion in 2008.
That doesn't include loan guarantees. The real scandal of Solyndra, the solar company that recently went bust, isn't that the taxpayers lost more than $500 million on a lousy bet by the Energy Department, but that the feds keep making these deals even when their rate of return is likely to be zero or negative. The Solyndra loan constituted less than 2% of the $40 billion in outstanding loan guarantees to dozens of energy companies, according to the House Budget Committee.
Republicans, for their part, favor handouts to the nuclear industry. Over the years the feds have provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees and cut-rate insurance to nuclear plants, though even nuclear-utility executives say new plants may not make economic sense in a world of cheap and abundant natural gas. Last month House Speaker John Boehner backed a $2 billion Energy Department loan guarantee sought by USEC Inc. for a uranium-enrichment plant in Piketon, Ohio.
• The Export-Import Bank has a portfolio of $14.5 billion of outstanding loan guarantees to assist major U.S. exporters. More than 90% of the funds went to 10 corporations, including Boeing ($6.4 billion), General Electric ($1.043 billion) and Caterpillar ($424 million).
Defenders claim government subsidies for business are justified because American firms must compete with subsidized firms from China and Europe. But as Milton Friedman was famous for advising: Never fight a subsidy with a subsidy. This industrial policy was also the rage in the 1970s and 1980s when Japan's
and Ministry of International Trade and Industry were going to dominate the world, but we know how that has worked for Tokyo.
For those who say this is good for American competitiveness, consider that ending all corporate welfare programs would finance a substantial cut in the 35% corporate income-tax rate that makes U.S. business less competitive but does a poor job of raising revenue because of these loopholes. A big rate cut would generate far more jobs and wealth than passing out checks to businesses one at a time.
As important as this economic damage is the corrosive effect that corporate welfare has on public trust in government. Americans understand that powerful government invariably favors the powerful, who have the means and access to massage Congress and the bureaucracy that average citizens do not. This really is aid to the 1% paid by the other 99%.
Yet the parade of subsidies gets longer each year, perhaps, as the old joke goes, because in Washington Republicans love corporations and Democrats love welfare. As House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan puts it: "How can we save billions of dollars from unjustified subsidy and entitlement programs, if we can't get corporate America off the dole?"
With American federal debt headed toward the worst European levels, this is an issue that should unite the tea party, the Occupy Wall Street protesters and Congressional deficit-cutters.

  Van Startup Strikes Deal For Assembly

DETROIT, Mich.—Bright Automotive Inc., a startup developing plug-in, hybrid-electric delivery vans, reached an agreement to have its vehicles assembled by AM General LLC, the military contractor that produced the original Hummer.
Bright, based in Rochester Hills, Mich., is one of several small companies looking to develop electric technology for commercial vehicles. Delivery trucks, work vans and other commercial vehicles are seen as more suited for electric vehicle technology than passenger cars because of the way companies use their fleets.
Commercial fleets typically travel consistent routes with lots of stops and starts and many miles. That type of driving lends itself to faster payback because of the fuel savings is greater than with consumer electric vehicles.
Commercial vehicles often are parked at night and on weekends, allowing for regular recharging. Two of the limitations of electric cars such as

Leaf are the range they can travel and time it takes to recharge them. The Leaf can go about 80 miles before needing a charge that can take between four and eight hours.
The manufacturing agreement is an important step. Last year the company received a $5 million investment from


investment arm, GM Ventures. AM General, of South Bend, Ind., develops military vehicles.
Bright applied for a loan guarantee from the Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program in 2008. Its application seeks a loan guarantee of "less than $400 million" to bring the van to market, said 



      Reuben Munger, 



       chairman and chief executive officer.
Bright's application may be hindered by the scrutiny now being paid to loans made to Fisker Automotive and


electric car startups. Some lawmakers have asked the energy department to pause new loan guarantees in the wake of the bankruptcy of California solar power company Solyndra LLC, which had a $527 million U.S. loan guarantee.
Mike Donoughe, 



       Bright's chief operating officer, said the company requires the loans to move forward in the United States, but might consider moving the venture to China if the loan guarantee isn't approved.
Bright's IDEA work van could be ready for production as soon as 2014, it says. The company estimates the vehicle could reduce diesel or gasoline consumption for many fleet customers by as much as 80%.

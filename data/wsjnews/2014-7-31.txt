  Panasonic to Help Build Tesla Battery Plant

    Financing Terms Remain Unclear in Pact Between  Japanese Electronics Firm, U.S. Electric-Car Maker

committed to help electric-car maker


build a U.S. battery plant, but part of the deal remains missing: the financing plan.
Panasonic said it would invest in equipment, machinery and other tools for the plant, which Tesla has said could cost as much as $5 billion. Panasonic's statement on Thursday gave few details beyond what it said in May when the companies signed a letter of intent to join in construction of the plant.
"We haven't decided yet on the specifics of when, or how much investment we will be making," Panasonic Chief Financial Officer 



      Hideaki Kawai



       said at a news conference in Tokyo. A person familiar with the matter said earlier that the company initially was planning to invest ¥20 billion to ¥30 billion, or roughly $200 million to $300 million, in the Tesla plant.
The Japanese electronics maker would occupy about half of the plant to make battery cells. U.S.-based Tesla has said the plant could total 10 million square feet and be capable of producing 35 gigawatt hours of battery cells annually, or more than all the combined lithium-ion battery production in the world today. Battery-industry competitors have been critical of the plan, questioning whether the plant's large size would lower costs significantly because much of the cost for batteries is commodity-based.
"The dollar commitment is somewhat underwhelming," said 



      Carter Driscoll, 



       a clean-technology analyst with investment-banking firm MLV & Co. "But I think they are playing a little bit of cat and mouse about who is going to pay for what," he added. "That's clearly not all Panasonic is going to commit to the facility."
In a joint statement, the companies said cost savings would come from "manufacturing cells that have been optimized for electric vehicle design." The plant would reduce transportation, duty and inventory-carrying costs to lower expenses, Tesla and Panasonic said.
Tesla said in February that it expected to invest about $2 billion of its own funds and wanted partners to pay for the rest of the plant, tapping Panasonic as well as raw-material suppliers for battery components.
Yet at the end of the first quarter, Tesla only had $2.4 billion in cash. Panasonic's expected modest initial investment could indicate that Tesla will need to scale back its plans or raise more capital to take on the project.
Colin Langan, 



       a UBS analyst who covers Tesla, said he expects the auto maker to raise more money to complete the project, though it should be able to fund some of the construction from profit the company generates in coming years. Mr. Driscoll also said Tesla will likely need to raise more money, either through convertible-debt or share sales. Earlier this year, Tesla raised $2 billion from a convertible-debt offering.
Tesla Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       has said he is confident that building the plant will lead to a 30% reduction in battery-pack costs, while also providing his company with as many as 500,000 battery packs a year. The electric-car company has been constrained in its ability to produce vehicles by a limited number of cells coming from Panasonic, its only battery supplier.
Panasonic already has an agreement to provide two billion battery cells to Tesla through 2017, the same year that the car maker plans to open the new battery factory. The Japanese company aims to double sales at its auto division in four years, making an expanded alliance with Tesla an attractive prospect.
Still, Panasonic executives, troubled by past investments on plasma displays that later went sour, remain cautious about ramping up spending too aggressively. Panasonic says it has compiled detailed risk scenarios and multiple backup plans in case demand for Tesla cars doesn't increase as expected.
The extended negotiations over the battery plant suggest the difficulty of matching Mr. Musk's ambitions for a factory that would be the largest under one roof in the U.S.—outstripping aircraft and auto plants—with Panasonic's more cautious approach. Tesla has so far declined to use batteries from other big manufacturers, even though the company has faced capacity obstacles for more than a year.
Panasonic has spent the past two years drastically restructuring its television, mobile-phone and semiconductor divisions to stem losses totaling $15 billion. In the latest measure to focus on growth, Panasonic said it would sell its mobile-phone base-station business to

of Finland. Panasonic and


also said they would form a joint venture with a government-backed fund and an


supplier to develop next-generation panel technology for tablet computers.
In a sign that its turnaround is taking hold, Panasonic said Thursday that operating profit rose 28% to ¥82 billion in its April-June quarter. Sales increased 1.5%, helped by strong performance in the company's housing and automotive businesses. Net profit fell 65% amid a one-time gain in the year-earlier period from a change in Panasonic's pension plan.
Mr. Kawai said Panasonic and Tesla were compiling a plan that would ensure profitability, while Panasonic would make its investments in phases that were in line with demand for Tesla vehicles. Tesla is scouting sites in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas, and economic-development officials in each state are readying incentive offers that include items such as expedited building permits and cheap electricity.
Like Panasonic, other Japanese electronics companies posted solid quarterly results Thursday, benefiting from years of restructuring to reduce their exposure to consumer electronics. That shift has also helped them cope better with a fall in domestic demand from a sales-tax increase that took effect in Japan in April, raising the tax to 8% from 5%.


said its first-quarter net profit more than doubled from a year earlier to ¥29 billion thanks to cost-cutting and robust demand for industrial electronics and machinery. In the latest measure to stem costs,

, a publicly traded subsidiary controlled by Hitachi, said last week it would cut 1,000 jobs in Japan.



, the world's No. 2 supplier of flash-memory chips after

, posted a 69% increase in first-quarter net profit. Strength in Toshiba's energy and infrastructure-related businesses helped offset a decline in sales of flash-memory chips used in smartphones and tablets.
Toshiba on Thursday announced new cuts in its business that makes TV sets and other visual products. It plans to halve the number of global sales sites to 12 by the first half of the fiscal year starting in April. The move will reduce the company's global workforce in that business by about 25% and is expected to cut fixed costs by ¥10 billion versus the current fiscal year, Toshiba said.


returned to profit for the April-June quarter, helped by steps it took to improve profitability of its mobile-phone business.
Panasonic, Fujitsu and Toshiba all kept their full-year forecasts unchanged. Hitachi raised its net-profit outlook for the April-September period by 9% from three months ago, citing improving macroeconomic conditions in Japan.
"I think the structural environment in Japan is getting close to the U.S. and Europe, and we are finally out of deflation," said 



      Toyoaki Nakamura, 



       Hitachi's chief financial officer.

  BMW to Expand Electric-Car Fast Charging

    Two New Attacks Aimed at Removing Major Obstacle to Cars' Adoption

is launching two attacks on one of the biggest obstacles to broader acceptance of electric cars such as its i3 model: the lack of fast recharging stations.
The German company unveiled a deal with U.S.-based


on Monday to allow owners of BMW i3 electric cars to recharge their batteries free of charge through 2015 at NRG eVgo charging stations in California. The free fast-recharging offer responds to rival


offer of free recharging for owners of the company's Model S at Tesla-owned charging stations.
In a separate move, BMW is collaborating with German engineering and automotive-technology company Robert Bosch GmbH to offer a compact fast-charging station that will be sold to BMW dealers and other businesses for $6,548, or about one-fifth the price of other fast-charging systems on the market, BMW officials said.
BMW plans to offer the charging stations, which weigh about 100 pounds and can be mounted on a wall, starting next month to BMW dealers and other businesses interested in offering electric-vehicle owners the ability to recharge batteries in 30 minutes, said 



      Cliff Fietzek, 



       manager of connected emobility for the auto maker's North American operations.
The BMW-Bosch recharging stations will use the SAE Combo plug system—which is being adopted by other global auto makers, including

,

,

and Volkswagen AG—but isn't used by Tesla. That means Tesla owners can't recharge at BMW recharging stations, and BMW i3 owners can't use Tesla's "Supercharger" stations.
BMW is discussing with other auto makers how to collaborate on expanding fast-charging networks, Mr. Fietzek said. BMW cooperates with rivals Volkswagen and Nissan on recharging-network development in Europe, he said.
BMW and other auto makers attempting to boost sales of electric cars continue to confront reluctance from would-be buyers worried that their batteries will run out of juice during a day's drive, leaving them stranded for hours far from a recharging station. While marketers of electric cars say that most consumers wouldn't drive far enough during a typical day to drain their batteries, this so-called range anxiety is a significant reason why all-electric vehicles now account for less than 1% of U.S. vehicle sales.
BMW's goal is to "seed the market with SAE Combo stations," said 



      Robert Healey, 



       electric-vehicle infrastructure manager for BMW's North American arm. "We want people to see these charging stations."
BMW's deal with NRG's eVgo has a similar aim.
NRG has projected that it will have 50 fast recharging stations in California by the end of this year, and 100 by the end of 2015, Mr. Healey said.
Tesla said it has 103 supercharger stations in operation throughout North America, allowing a Model S owner to drive across the U.S., albeit on a defined route.
By 2015, Tesla said it aims to have supercharger stations available to 98% of the U.S. population and parts of Canada.

  Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks Close Sharply Lower

MARKETS AT A GLANCE
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT:
U.S. stocks closed sharply lower, with the Dow posting its biggest single-day selloff since February, with traders saying there was no single catalyst for the stumble. Oil prices slid to a 19-week low on news that a refinery in Kansas could be closed for four weeks after a fire. Gold prices closed at their lowest level in six weeks. Treasurys ended mixed and the dollar gained against rivals as investors await Friday's important U.S. employment report.
OPENING CALL:
Several Asian nations will unveil their manufacturing purchasing manager indexes Friday, including China, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia and India. The question these PMI readings could answer is whether the apparent stabilization in China's economy, which showed a modest acceleration in the second quarter, helped sustain business activity around the rest of the region as it entered the third quarter. Australia's stock market, for one, has rallied sharply on hopes that a China rebound will spur earning growth. And yet prices for many of the key industrial commodities that China imports remain depressed, which could suppress growth in Australia and other commodity-producing nations such as Indonesia. On the other hand, there are a signs of a regional pickup in electronics orders associated with smartphones, in part because of upgrades to Apple models and in part because of rising consumer demand in China and other countries with an emerging middle class.
EQUITIES:
U.S. stocks ended July with a more than 300-point selloff for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a swoon that snapped a five-month winning streak for the broader market.
Traders said there was no single catalyst for the stumble, though selling started early and accelerated into Thursday's closing bell, dragging the Dow into negative territory, down 0.1%, for 2014.
Investors said an upbeat reading from the labor market sowed concerns about the Federal Reserve possibly raising rates quicker than many investors anticipate. Some pointed to disappointing earnings reports from U.S. companies Thursday, which disrupted what has been a strong season for corporate profits. Others pointed to Argentina's default on some bonds and fresh worries that the euro zone's central bank will need to provide more stimulus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 317.06 points, or 1.9%, to 16563.30. The S&P 500 shed 39.40 points, or 2%, to 1930.67 and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 93.13 points, or 2.1%, to 4369.77.
"There are so many things that are coming to a head simultaneously," said Joe Spinelli, head of Americas single stock trading at Deutsche Bank. "Clients are wanting to get into a position to ride out any storm that might pop up."
In corporate news, Exxon Mobil fell 4.2% after its second-quarter earnings rose 28% but production declined.
Asian markets ended mostly higher Thursday. China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.9%. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average slipped 0.2%.
FOREX:
A rally in the dollar is picking up steam, as signs of accelerating U.S. growth bolster investor expectations that the Federal Reserve in the coming year will raise interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis.
The dollar hit a fresh eight-month high against the euro on Wednesday, bringing the greenback's gains against the common currency to 4.5% since early May. On Thursday, the U.S. currency was on track to close higher again.
But more telling, investors and analysts said, was the dollar's performance against other currencies, where it has been dormant or in decline in recent months. The dollar rose against the Japanese yen by the most in four months on Wednesday after an initial reading on second-quarter U.S. growth came in stronger than expected. The data also drove the dollar to a one-month high against the British pound.
This broad-based rise in the dollar is vindication for investors whose bullish bets were derailed earlier in the year by softness in the U.S. economy and doubts about the trajectory of the Fed's monetary policy.
A slight change in the way the Fed addressed inflation in its statement this week gave some investors even more reason to be optimistic about the dollar. The Fed said inflation has "moved somewhat closer" to the central bank's longer-term target. Previously, the Fed said inflation had "been running below" target.
For many investors, that change of phrase cemented the belief that the Fed was on its way toward its first rate hike since 2006, in contrast with other major central banks in regions still struggling to shore up growth. Higher rates, or the expectation of higher rates, lure fund managers, and tend to lead to currency appreciation.
"We may be at the start of the shift," said Eric Stein, co-head of the global income team at Eaton Vance Management, which oversees $12.8 billion in assets and is betting on the dollar's rise. "The theme of diverging developed-market central banks hasn't played out so far in 2014. It's now playing out in currency-market price action."
BONDS:
U.S. Treasurys managed to crawl out of deeper losses, but ended July on a mixed note, as investors await Friday's important U.S. employment report.
Divergent economic signals and typical month-end buying by fund managers caused price swings throughout the session. By late-afternoon, prices on benchmark 10-year notes were 3/32 lower to yield 2.565%, according on Tradeweb, despite a sharp selloff in U.S. stocks. Two-year notes gained 2/32 to yield 0.535%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.
"The market is a bit uneasy about the Fed's [signals], and we also have a lot of geopolitical risks that aren't getting any better, and it's month end. That all creates a soup of volatility," said Wilmer Stith, portfolio manager of the Wilmington Broad Market Bond Fund.
COMMODITIES:
U.S. oil futures slumped on news that a refinery in Kansas could be closed for four weeks after a fire, reducing demand for crude oil.
CVR Refining LP's 115,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Coffeyville, Kan., could be closed for four weeks following a fire on Tuesday that injured four employees, said Chief Executive John Lipinski on a conference call Thursday.
The company expects the shutdown to reduce its refinery crude-oil throughput from 212,000 barrels a day in the second quarter to between 165,000 and 175,000 barrels a day in the third quarter.
The Coffeyville refinery is close to Cushing, Okla., an important oil-storage hub where the Nymex price is set.
Speculative traders, including hedge funds, pension funds and managed-money funds, took on record-high bets on rising U.S. and global oil prices last month after an insurgency broke out in Iraq, prompting fears of a large supply disruption. Now those traders may be closing out their bets, pushing prices lower, said Anthony Lerner, senior vice president of industrial commodities at brokerage R.J. O'Brien in New York.
"The speculators have been very, very long, so it doesn't take much to drive the price lower," he said.
Gold prices closed at their lowest level in six weeks, after jobless claims data pointed to a potentially strong U.S. employment number for July.

have pushed the boundaries of avant-garde performance art as far as 



      Robert Wilson



       has. Though best known for often shocking experimental theater, Mr. Wilson, 72, has delighted and confounded audiences by leveraging the technology of the day to great effect across a range of art forms, from opera (such as his daringly lighted production of Philip Glass's 1976 work "



      Einstein



       on the Beach") to video art (most recently, hi-def video "portraits" of Lady Gaga) to chair designs (like his series of transparent polycarbonate seats illuminated from within by white neon tubes).
Perhaps nothing captures Mr. Wilson's controversial creativity, however, like the annual gala he hosts at the Watermill Center in Water Mill, N.Y., a "laboratory for performance" (per its tagline) that gives young artists of all stripes free rein. Tonight, the roughly 100 who were selected for summer residencies will take over the campus to show off their work using elaborate sets, inventive lighting and newfangled props. (Think: a man running on an outdoor treadmill beneath a flashing neon sign—an installation by

  Stocks Swing, Ending Lower 

    Major Equity Indexes Post Weekly Losses

A roller-coaster Friday ended a turbulent week for U.S. stocks that left benchmark indexes reeling.
Buffeted by worries about how quickly the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, volatility in credit markets and a general sense that stocks' multiyear rally is getting long in the tooth, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell into the red for 2014 and the S&P 500 stumbled to its worst weekly loss in more than two years.
U.S. stocks began Friday on a bleak note. Before the open, stock-index futures were down, reflecting a weak trading session in Europe. They recovered somewhat after the July jobs report, released at 8.30 a.m. EDT, indicated the economy was growing although not enough to prompt the Fed to bring forward its plans to raise interest rates. The Dow was up by as much as 21 points in midmorning trading. But the gains proved short-lived, and blue chips were down as much as 126 points by noon.
The Dow ended the day down 69.93 points, or 0.4%, to 16493.37. Those losses came on the heels of a 317-point selloff Thursday, which left the average down 2.8% for the week, its worst weekly decline since the week ended Jan. 24.
The damage to the S&P 500 was worse for the week. It shed 53.19 points, or 2.7%, to 1925.15, its largest weekly point decline since May 2012 and its largest percentage drop since June 2012.
In particular, traders said that investors, nervous about European and U.S. credit markets, were selling baskets of U.S. stocks as a way to protect their portfolios against potential losses in those markets. And with much of the U.S. stock market trading at rich valuations, and some investors nervous about the prospect for less-friendly policies from the Fed, potential buyers saw little reason to rush into the market, traders said.
That is a change from recent trends, traders said, when investors would take advantage of any weakness to buy stocks on the cheap.
Reflecting the gyrations, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a gauge of broad-market swings implied by the options market, rose 0.5%, capping a 34% rise on the week.
Traders said the stock declines were exacerbated by a seasonal summer slump in trading activity and big Wall Street trading desks' decreased capacity to take on big positions in the wake of new rules adopted after the financial crisis.
"It's just hard to put your finger on one thing," said Viren Chandrasoma, managing director in equities at

.
During the worst of Friday's losses, investors were selling stocks to build cash cushions or hedge against potential losses in other markets, said 



      David Lutz, 



       head of exchange-traded fund trading at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC. "Wouldn't you be raising capital through selling an asset that's near all-time highs and that people think is kind of frothy?" he said, referring to some investors' concerns that stocks' gains in recent years have left them richly valued.
Of particular focus were U.S. and European credit markets. High-yield bonds and debt issued by European countries perceived as relatively risky declined in price, in part due to concerns about the financial woes of Portuguese lender

and Argentina's debt default.
The iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond exchange-traded fund lost 0.8% Friday and fell 1.8% for the week.
Adding to the negative tone, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ruled that sellers of credit-default swaps tied to Argentine sovereign debt—essentially insurance contracts against a default—must pay buyers.
Still, some fund managers said they were buying U.S. stocks during the week's downdraft.
"It was great buying stocks [Thursday], because they were all on sale," said 



      Mark Spellman, 



       portfolio manager with Alpine Funds, which oversees about $2.1 billion. "I'm not overly concerned, because the fundamental picture still looks pretty good."
Friday's losses were surprising given what many investors saw as a bullish jobs report. While a 209,000 rise in nonfarm payrolls was below expectations, it was enough to please stock investors.
The jobs number "is in something of a psychological sweet spot," said 



      Alan Gayle, 



       who oversees about $350 million as director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments. "It's a solid gain, but it's lower than consensus…it takes the pressure off of the Fed to begin raising rates soon."
"The economy seems to be improving, and confidence is improving as well," said 



      Sean Lynch, 



       managing director of global equities at Wells Fargo Private Bank, which oversees $170 billion. With little evidence of wage inflation, there's little chance the Fed will raise interest rates sooner than the market expects, he said.
Treasury prices rose, sending the yield on the 10-year note down to 2.505%.
Shares of utilities and consumer-staples firms, seen as the market's defensive corners, rose.
The Russell 2000 index of small-company shares fell 0.5%, reversing an earlier 0.3% gain.
The

  Tesla Motors' Loss Widens on Higher Spending

    Auto Maker Ramps Up Effort to Develop Second Electric Vehicle

said its second-quarter loss increased to $62 million, or 50 cents a share, from a $31 million loss a year ago as the company ramped up spending to develop its second electric vehicle, added workers and expanded into China.
Tesla said it delivered 7,579 Model S vehicles in the quarter, a bit above the 7,500 it had forecast. But Tesla lowered its forecast for revenue and deliveries for the third quarter to 7,800 vehicles from 9,500 because it had to shut down its factory in Fremont, Calif., to install equipment in July. Tesla said it should be able to ramp up production in the final three months of 2014 to reach its sales goal of 35,000.
Earlier Thursday, Tesla and


said they had reached an agreement for the battery maker to participate in the construction and operation of the world's largest battery factory in the U.S. The so-called Gigafactory would be an investment of as much as $5 billion and employ 6,500 people, giving Tesla battery capacity for up to 500,000 vehicles a year.
Panasonic, earlier Thursday, reported that operating profit rose 28% to ¥82 billion ($798 million) in the April-June quarter. Sales increased 1.5%, helped by strong performance in its housing and automotive businesses. Net profit dropped 65% owing to a one-time gain in the year-ago period from a change in its pension scheme.
Tesla said it expects its annualized pace of deliveries will hit 100,000 vehicles by the end of next year, as it ramps up production of its Model X sport utility vehicle. In addition to that forecast, Chief Executive Officer 



      Elon Musk



       boldly predicted that within 10 years, Tesla's electric cars are "heading to a place of no contest when it comes to gasoline," meaning electric cars will be lower cost.
Tesla said in its shareholder letter that it began site work near Reno, Nev., in June but continues to evaluate other locations in Arizona, California, Texas and New Mexico. Mr. Elon Musk, in a call with analysts, said the company would begin site work at one or more other sites and that the company was trying to work with local governments, which he expected would pay for up to 10% of the total project costs.
Revenue for Tesla rose 89% from a year earlier to $769 million. The average automotive revenue per electric car was about $101,000 during the quarter. The company said in a statement that demand for the Model S continues to rise in North America and Europe.
"We believe these markets remain underpenetrated," the auto maker said, addressing concerns expressed by some analysts that sales growth in the U.S. and Europe was cooling off.
Tesla addressed another concern, saying that increased battery cell production by Panasonic in Japan should allow for higher production.
Tesla's earnings were reduced by a noncash interest expense related to raising $2.3 billion in convertible notes earlier this year and stock-based compensation for executives. Tesla's loss from operations rose to $28.7 million as research-and-development costs and overhead jumped 20% combined from the first quarter.
Earnings excluding stock-based executive compensation and the noncash interest expense were $16 million, or 11 cents a share, better than the 4-cent a share consensus forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
Tesla adjusted revenue, which takes into account deferred leasing revenue, was $858 million for the quarter. The leases help overall deliveries, but put a lid on top-line GAAP revenue.
Similar to the second quarter, Tesla said its costs would jump in the third quarter to fuel research and development and new employment, with R&D spending rising 20% and overhead increasing 15%. The company said it would be "marginally profitable" on a basis that adjusts for the lease accounting, stock-based compensation and noncash interest expense.
Tesla also said its spending on capital expenses for 2014 could be as high as $950 million, up from an earlier forecast of $850 million.
"We are not currently showing all our cards," he said. "Our cap-ex and R&D numbers are better than they appear because there are things you don't know about."

  SpaceX to Launch Commercial Rockets in Texas

    Brownsville,Usually Mentioned in Connection With Smuggling and Illegal Immigration, Gets a Boost

Brownsville doesn't get much national attention, and when it does, it can be an unflattering reference to drug smuggling or illegal immigration. But soon, this Texas city across the Rio Grande from Mexico hopes it will be regarded more positively as a gateway to the stars.
SpaceX, the space-transport company founded by entrepreneur 



      Elon Musk, 



       plans to build the world's first exclusively commercial orbital launch pad just northeast of Brownsville along the Gulf of Mexico, Texas officials and SpaceX announced on Monday.
Texas helped sweeten the deal to land the launch pad with $2.3 million in incentives from the Texas Enterprise Fund, a pool the state uses to recruit and retain businesses. It is also providing an additional $13 million from a separate space-projects fund to help finance project infrastructure.
"SpaceX is excited to expand our work in Texas with the world's first commercial launch complex designed specifically for orbital missions," Mr. Musk said in a statement released by the office of Texas Gov. Rick Perry.
The project would still require final approval from the federal government, but the prospect has buoyed public leaders and citizens in Brownsville, a largely Hispanic city of 180,000, where more than a third of residents live below the federal poverty line.
"We would become a portal to outer space. How cool is that?" said 



      Gilbert Salinas, 



       an economic-development coordinator for Brownsville.
Mr. Salinas estimates that construction and operation of the launch site could create 500 jobs over a 10-year period and generate more than $50 million annually in new salaries alone. The stimulus could be greater, he said, if companies decide to set up shop in the area to provide ancillary services to the launch complex.
SpaceX, according to company filings with the Federal Aviation Administration, proposes as many as 12 unmanned rocket launches a year, carrying satellites and other cargo into orbit for business customers, as well as other suborbital launches of reusable space vehicles. Earlier this month, the FAA gave environmental approval to SpaceX's proposal to launch rockets from a beachfront about 17 miles northeast of Brownsville.
There has been no indication that SpaceX will do space tourism, at least in the near future. SpaceX also does launches from Florida for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, carrying cargo to the International Space Station, and has overseen commercial launches in Florida.
The mayor of Brownsville, 



      Tony Martinez, 



       has an "Occupy Mars" beach towel hanging in his office, a gift from an employee of SpaceX, whose founder has long dreamed of sending manned missions to the red planet. T-shirts worn by local boosters proclaim "Launch Brownsville" on the front and "Transforming Destiny" on the back.
Considered one of the country's leading innovators, Mr. Musk, 43 years old, helped create the online-payment system PayPal before co-founding electric-car maker Tesla Motors Inc., as well as SpaceX.
Support for the space pad has been strong in Brownsville, drowning out concerns over possible negative impacts such as noise from the booms at takeoff. At two public hearings hosted by the FAA in 2012 and 2013, supporters included children dressed in space suits and a group of students with a seven-foot rocket, according to people in attendance.
After attending one hearing, "I wanted to go to Brownsville," said Dale Ketcham, Chief of Strategic Alliances at Space Florida, one of the other sites that competed for the launch pad. "The enthusiasm with which this town greeted this opportunity was positively infectious."
In testimony last year to Texas lawmakers about the proposed Brownsville site, Mr. Musk said that it would be "logical" for SpaceX to one day manufacture rockets at a facility near its commercial spaceport, wherever it is ultimately located.
Micah Walter-Range, research director at the Space Foundation, a Colorado Springs-based nonprofit, said the Brownsville site also would help position Texas as a leader in the growing commercial-space industry, which last year generated about $240 billion in revenue globally.
He cautioned, however, that it could take years before the Texas site reaps dividends. "Doing things in space is difficult," he said. "There could be delays and glitches setting up the infrastructure for a launch site."
Although the economic payoff remains uncertain, many residents believe an affiliation with SpaceX could provide a significant image makeover for the city.
Anthony Knopp, a board member of the Brownsville Convention & Visitors Bureau who is also a history professor at the University of Texas at Brownsville, said he has learned of people who were reluctant to move or even visit Brownsville because they feared spillover violence from the drug cartels in Mexico.
The launch pad "would be a dramatic development for a community having a tough time," he said, adding, "It's more than just SpaceX. It's the idea that Elon Musk, this visionary entrepreneur, would want to be associated with Brownsville."

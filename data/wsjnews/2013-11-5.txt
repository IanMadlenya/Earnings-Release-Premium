  China's Tesla Risks Overcharging

isn't the only stock exciting investors about the future of electric cars. Chinese electric-car maker

—backed by a major investment from 



      Warren Buffett



      —has seen its Hong Kong-listed shares soar 153% in the past year, even as Chinese auto stocks are up 66%. This charge could be set to power down.
Investors have gotten excited about BYD thanks both to Tesla's meteoric rise, and because China's central government said in September that it would help cities add new electric cars and subsidize new buyers over the next two years.
The problem is not only that investors are assuming the technology will commercially succeed. That's an issue with Tesla, too, as it looks to sell ever larger numbers of cars. With BYD, investors are also assuming that this sprawling company is focused enough to sell a meaningful number of electric cars.
But, unlike Tesla, half the company isn't even car-related. BYD gets 47% of its revenue from making handset components, solar cells and rechargeable batteries. And those are highly competitive businesses that are hardly profitable. BYD's auto business doesn't buzz either, having lost market share three years running, according to LMC Automotive.
Despite BYD's reputation for expertise in battery technology, less than 1% of the cars it sells are electric. BYD's electric cars trailed behind Chery and Jianghuai Auto in terms of electric vehicle sales in 2012, says Macquarie's 



      Janet Lewis.
This means BYD may not be the biggest beneficiary of an electric-car boom. Its gasoline-powered models, which make up the bulk of sales, are low-end, and for now aren't selling enough to justify BYD's lofty stock price.
That leaves much of the company's future success reliant on continued state largess. The main buyers of electric vehicles are local governments who use them for taxi fleets and other public uses. Government subsidies for items such as research and development were 57% of pretax profit for the first nine of months of 2013. Strip out nonrecurring income such as subsidies, and net profit fell 123% year-over-year between January and September, says Ms. Lewis.
But hope seems to spring eternal for electric-car investors. BYD trades at 53 times forward earnings. Granted, that is less than the 100-times multiple Tesla fetches. But BYD's valuation is four times the second-richest Hong Kong-listed auto maker, Brilliance China Auto, and nearly double its own five-year average, according to FactSet.
Tesla's valuation and heady share-price rise this year raise questions about the U.S. company, but at least that's a pure bet on a single polarizing question—will electric cars prove a commercial success? With BYD, investors are betting on too many other things also falling into place.

  Stocks Drop Amid Fed Worries

    Positive GDP Data Stir Tapering Fears

Stocks slumped, dragged down by concerns over what stronger-than-expected U.S. growth might mean for Federal Reserve policy, as well as weakness in the technology sector.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 152.90 points, or 1%, to finish at 15593.98. The blue-chip reading erased an early rise to an all-time intraday high of 15797.68 before reversing course to suffer the biggest one-day point decline in a month.
A surprise interest-rate cut from the European Central Bank provided the early boost for stocks.
The S&P 500 index shed 23.34 points, or 1.3%, to 1747.15, the biggest percentage loss in over two months. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 74.61 points, or 1.9%, to 3857.33, a three-week low, weighed down by a disappointing quarterly report from tech-sector heavyweight


"There was some negative sentiment coming in today," said Paul Powers, head of U.S. equity sales trading at Raymond James, referring to Qualcomm's results released late Wednesday. Then investors had to deal with the ECB rate cut and worries about overseas growth, as well as the U.S. GDP data, he said.
"That gave people pause," Mr. Powers said, and a reason to "cash in" some gains.
The first read on third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product showed growth of 2.8%, up from 2.5% in the second quarter and well above expectations of 2%. The price index for personal consumer expenditures—the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation—grew 1.9% versus forecasts of a 1.6% rise.
Initial claims for jobless benefits totaled 336,000 in the latest week, down from a revised 345,000 the week before and close to expectations of 335,000. Investors will now turn their attention to the closely watched October U.S. employment report due Friday.
"There's a drift in the conversations about Fed policy," said 



      John Rutledge, 



       chief market strategist at New York-based global investment firm SAFANAD. "People are conflicted between thinking growth is good, because growth gives us more profits, and thinking more growth means the Fed is inclined to start" reducing stimulus efforts.
Investors continued to flip-flop over expectations of Fed policy. Recently, there has been a growing belief that the Fed could start reducing stimulus measures by cutting back on its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program as early as December. Just two weeks ago, disappointing September jobs data had investors believing the Fed wouldn't move until March, or even June.
"This obsession of trying to time the Fed is fascinating," said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Wealth Management. Over the longer term, he said it doesn't really matter whether the Fed starts tapering bond purchases in December or March. "In the grand scheme, what matters is, are they going to taper? Yes," Mr. Florance said.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.613% from 2.638% late Wednesday.
Separately, the trading debut of

the biggest technology initial public offering since Facebook last year, offered investors a distraction from the debate over Fed policy. Twitter surged out of the gate before closing 73% above the $26 IPO price.
"There's nothing wrong with a 'fun' IPO," Mr. Florance said. "It's nice to see the IPO market is backed up and active. That's how capitalism works."
Earlier, the market got a brief jolt higher after the ECB cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25% from 0.5%. European equity markets initially rallied on the ECB's move, then erased those gains amid concerns the nascent recovery in Europe may be fading. The 



      Stoxx Europe 600



       closed virtually unchanged, erasing early gains, when the index rose as much as 1.5% to the highest level seen in over five years.
The euro dropped to a near two-month low against the dollar before recovering slightly.
In corporate news, Qualcomm dropped after the semiconductor maker reported late Wednesday fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings that rose slightly less than expected, according to FactSet, and provided a first-quarter outlook that was below current analyst projections.

declined after the electric-car maker said it was investigating a fire involving one of its Model S sedans, which is the third reported fire within a month.
December crude-oil futures fell 0.6% to settle at $94.20 a barrel, and November gold futures shed 0.7% to $1,308.40 an ounce.
Asian markets were broadly lower, with Japan's Nikkei Stock Average shedding 0.8%, weighed down by disappointing results from Toyota Motor. China's Shanghai Composite lost 0.5%.

  Stocks End Higher; Dow Sets Record

    Better-Than-Expected Data, Fed Hopes Lift Sentiment

Stocks rose Wednesday, with the Dow industrials setting another record, on growing investor hopes for continued easy-money policies from the Federal Reserve.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 128.66 points, or 0.8%, to close at a new record of 15746.88. The blue-chip stock average has hit 33 all-time highs so far this year.
The S&P 500 climbed 7.52 points, or 0.4%, to 1770.49. It is up 24% this year to date. The

mposite Index slipped 7.92 points, or 0.2%, to 3931.95, as declines in biotechnology stocks weighed on the index.
Better-than-expected economic data from Europe helped support markets in early trading. But hopes for continuing stimulus efforts from the Fed drove much of the day's advance, sparking gains in interest-rate-sensitive stock sectors and Treasury prices. In recent months, markets have swung alongside investor expectations for the central bank's timeline for trimming, or "tapering", its bond-buying program.
"On a day like today, when people think the taper may take longer, stocks rally," said Paul Karos, senior portfolio manager for Whitebox Advisors, which manages $2.6 billion. But he hasn't changed his outlook, he said, adding that markets owed their Wednesday moves to "mainly the ebb and flow of speculation."
Utilities, telecommunications and consumer-staples sectors led gainers in the S&P 500, adding 1.3%, 1.1% and 1%, respectively. Those sectors often trade as proxies for the bond market, and sold off sharply over the summer after the Fed said it would consider paring back its bond-buying program.
Mr. Karos said that his firm has been cautious about buying stocks in those sectors, and making sure to choose investments that will hold up when Treasury yields rise.
"We do know that the Fed is likely to taper, it's just a question of when," he said.
Small stocks and biotechnology stocks declined. The two sectors outperformed earlier this year, amid higher expectations of a Fed pullback before the end of the year. The Russell 2000 Index, a small-stock benchmark, slipped 0.4%. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index fell 3%.
Treasury prices gained as well after a Wall Street Journal report brought attention to a recent paper from a central-bank official arguing that unemployment might need to fall much lower before rate increases would be effective. The yield on the 10-year note fell to 2.638% from a three-week high of 2.662% late Tuesday.
In Europe, stocks gained after better-than-expected economic data and as expectations remained that the European Central Bank may also act to bolster the economy, possibly as soon as Thursday's policy decision.
"Investors will be watching the ECB announcement closely in light of last week's euro-zone inflation report, which was worryingly low," said 



      Stephen Macklow-Smith, 



       a European equities portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which oversees $1.5 trillion of assets. "It's possible the ECB will decide to trim interest rates at the margin."
In the U.S., an index tracking forward-looking economic indicators rose by more than expected. The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for September rose 0.7% on the month, while a rise of 0.6% was forecast.
The morning's data show "that the global economy is doing well," said 



      Chris Gaffney, 



       senior market strategist with EverBank Wealth Management.
But Friday's closely watched October employment report will take top billing this week, as investors try to determine when the Fed could start paring its easy-money policies. Central-bank officials have said they will pay close attention to the labor market to determine when the economy is strong enough to weather a paring of stimulus efforts.
Investors also were watching for pricing of Twitter's initial public offering, due late in the day Wednesday. The social-media company raised its proposed price range to between $23 and $25 a share this week, up from between $17 and $20 a share, amid strong demand. That increases the potential size of the IPO to $2 billion from $1.6 billion.
In earnings news,

tumbled after the electric-car maker reported third-quarter results. Adjusted earnings and revenue were above analyst estimates but not by as much as many investors had hoped. In addition, Model S deliveries in the quarter were less than some analysts were expecting.
Tesla shares had gained 32% since the second-quarter report, and by more than 400% year to date.


slid after the teen-apparel retailer reported revenue fell more than expected, weighed down by sharp declines in U.S. and international same-store sales.
The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted mortgage applications index fell 7% in the latest week amid declines in both refinancings and purchase activity.
Crude-oil futures rose 1.5% to settle at $94.80 a barrel, after settling at a five-month low on Tuesday. Gold futures gained 0.7% to settle at $1,317.70 a troy ounce. The dollar edged higher against the yen but eased against the euro.
The Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.4% on the positive data and ECB easing hopes. Germany's DAX 30 index advanced 0.4% to a new record high, France's CAC 40 index climbed 0.8% and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index edged down 0.1%.
Data firm Markit said its October composite purchasing managers index for the euro area slipped to 51.9 from 52.2 in September, but was revised up slightly from an earlier reading. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.
In addition, the services PMI for the euro zone fell to 51.6 in October from September's 52.2, but topped expectations of 50.9. U.K. industrial production for September rose 0.9% on the month versus expectations of a 0.5% increase.
Asian markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.8%, supported by a weaker yen, while China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.8%.

  Bubble Trouble for Electric-Car Maker Tesla

That hissing sound? It is the air coming out of

' shares.
The electric-car maker's stock fell 17% in October, registering its first monthly decline since February and the worst since 2010. Even so, it is up 372% this year, a performance that marks it out as a potential bubble.
"Bubble" is a word that needs to be treated with more care than it often is. Sometimes a stock rockets higher not because investors have become irrationally exuberant but because they have sniffed out a company's potential.
An example: In the giddy year of 1999,

stock rose 2,618%. Much of that move was, in retrospect, excessive, but not all of it. At its 2001 nadir, the stock was still 494% higher than it had been on the last day of 1998.
But Tesla shares exhibit two characteristics that behavioral-finance specialists have found are common in bubbles: Investors are paying an extremely high price for them, and they are trading them like crazy.
Tesla trades at about 100 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, a valuation that can be justified only by extraordinarily optimistic assumptions about how many cars it will sell in the distant future (an exercise bullish analysts have performed to justify ever-higher price targets). Yet, at a recent event in London, even Tesla Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       reportedly said the company had "a higher valuation than we have any right to deserve."
Meanwhile, investors are flipping Tesla at a rapid-fire pace. Over the past 20 trading days, an average of 10 million Tesla shares, nearly one-tenth of its 121 million shares outstanding, have changed hands daily.
So Tesla's entire market capitalization now turns over in a bit more than two weeks. At the start of the year, it would have taken about 17 weeks of trading to turn over Tesla. It takes more than a year for
' shares outstanding to do so.
Bubbles often have their roots in a fundamental success, and it is worth considering how well Tesla has done. Mr. Musk said he would build a high-performance electric sports car; he did. Next, he said he would sell a luxury car to broaden Tesla's appeal; he has done that, too. Anyone who bet against Tesla on the idea the company would fall short of those goals found it cost them dearly.
Early success, coupled with the high cost of shorting stocks—selling borrowed shares in hopes of buying them back more cheaply later—is one reason bubbles can get going. Shorting entails paying fees that going long doesn't, while potential losses if prices go the wrong way are much higher. So rather than betting against a highflying stock, many skeptics will stay away, effectively leaving trading to true believers.
But skeptics don't stay away forever, and on Tesla it seems they are starting to circle now. At a Heard on the Street conference last month, noted short seller 



      James Chanos



       of Kynikos Associates criticized the lengths bullish analysts have gone in trying to justify Tesla's valuation. At a Chicago conference this week, Leon Cooperman, founder of hedge fund Omega Advisors, took a shot at Tesla's roughly $20 billion market capitalization: "I think we all know how that is going to end," he said.
Before shorts swoop in, Princeton University economists Markus Brunnermeier and Dilip Abreu have pointed out, the skeptics face a coordination problem. Individually, they don't have enough firepower to pop the bubble, so for fear of losing their shirts, they need to know others are on board. Something has to happen to give them the courage to step in.
The drop in Tesla's shares over the past month may have helped boost skeptics' confidence. But with the company set to report third-quarter results Tuesday, they may still be wary. If it doesn't wow Wall Street, that wariness will disappear.
For Tesla, it looks like a make or deflate quarter.

  Daimler Could Build New Model in U.S.

    Luxury Auto Maker Considers Other Mercedes-Benz Vehicles at Alabama Factory

could consider making more models beyond its Mercedes-Benz C-class car at a plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, as the German luxury auto maker seeks to improve profitability, limit currency risk and reduce transportation costs by moving production closer to customers.
Daimler will begin C-class production in Tuscaloosa next year, marking the first sedan production at a plant that has been producing sport-utility vehicles since 1997.
"We can do theoretically some other cars in Tuscaloosa," Bodo Uebber, Daimler's chief financial officer, said on Thursday in New York. Mr. Uebber said no decisions have been made but stressed that flexibility in production is key to succeed in a competitive market.
Once the world's top-selling luxury car maker, Daimler fell behind

and

Audi in global sales recent years. Now, Daimler is in the midst of a product offensive to try to regain that global sales crown. The Stuttgart, Germany-based auto maker also is under pressure to improve its profitability. Its profit margin in the third quarter rose to 7.3% from 6.4% a year ago.
Four years ago, Daimler announced plans to move production of the top selling C-Class model to the Alabama plant from Germany to protect it from currency fluctuations and reduce labor and transportation costs.
Mr. Uebber said the company also is interested in expanding its partnership with electric vehicle maker Tesla Motors Inc., in which the Daimler owns a 4.3% stake. "We want to look for more cooperation," he said.
The strategic benefits of developing new technology with Tesla outweigh the economic benefits of cashing in on its stake in the Silicon Valley auto maker whose shares have more than tripled this year, he said. "I am a happy shareholder," he said.
The auto maker has rethought its view on electric vehicles. "A couple of years ago we thought it was going to be hype," Mr. Uebber said. Now, he thinks that electric vehicles will get more traction when customers see "how nice you can drive."
Daimler will be releasing an electric B-class vehicle next year using Tesla's motor and battery, he said.

  Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks Drop

MARKETS AT A GLANCE
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT
A stronger-than-expected U.S. growth report and its possible implications on Federal Reserve policy sent stocks lower and Treasurys higher. The dollar climbed to a seven-week high against euro after a surprise ECB rate cut. The dollar's strength pushed gold and oil lower.
OPENING CALL
With the debut of Twitter done, investors will focus on some key economic data, such as China's industrial production and the U.S. unemployment report, the latter of which will contribute to the debate over Federal Reserve policy, and whether bank officials will start reducing stimulus efforts.
EQUITIES
Stocks slumped, dragged down by concerns over what stronger-than-expected U.S. growth might mean for Federal Reserve policy, as well as weakness in the technology sector.
A surprise interest-rate cut from the European Central Bank provided the early boost for stocks.
"There was some negative sentiment coming in today," said Paul Powers, head of U.S. equity sales trading at Raymond James, referring to Qualcomm's results released late Wednesday. Then investors had to deal with the ECB rate cut and worries about overseas growth, as well as the U.S. GDP data, he said.
"That gave people pause," Mr. Powers said, and a reason to "cash in" some gains.
The first read on third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product showed growth of 2.8%, up from 2.5% in the second quarter and well above expectations of 2%. The price index for personal consumer expenditures--the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation--grew 1.9% versus forecasts of a 1.6% rise.
Initial claims for jobless benefits totaled 336,000 in the latest week, down from a revised 345,000 the week before and close to expectations of 335,000. Investors will now turn their attention to the closely watched October U.S. employment report due Friday.
"There's a drift in the conversations about Fed policy," said John Rutledge, chief market strategist at New York-based global investment firm SAFANAD. "People are conflicted between thinking growth is good, because growth gives us more profits, and thinking more growth means the Fed is inclined to start" reducing stimulus efforts.
Separately, the trading debut of Twitter, the biggest technology initial public offering since Facebook last year, offered investors a distraction from the debate over Fed policy. Twitter surged out of the gate before closing 73% above the $26 IPO price.
"There's nothing wrong with a 'fun' IPO," Mr. Florance said. "It's nice to see the IPO market is backed up and active. That's how capitalism works."
In other corporate news, Qualcomm dropped after the semiconductor maker reported late Wednesday fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings that rose slightly less than expected, according to FactSet, and provided a first-quarter outlook that was below current analyst projections.
Tesla Motors declined after the electric-car maker said it was investigating a fire involving one of its Model S sedans, which is the third reported fire within a month.
Gap reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter sales growth, results that benefited from a strong showing in October. The apparel retailer also offered a rosy profit outlook for the third-quarter. Shares climbed after hours.
Asian markets finished were broadly lower Thursday, with Japan's Nikkei Stock Average shedding 0.8%, weighed down by disappointing results from Toyota Motor. China's Shanghai Composite lost 0.5%.
FOREX
The euro plummeted against the dollar after the European Central Bank surprised markets by cutting interest rates to a record low in an effort to protect the region's tepid economic recovery.
At its monthly meeting, the ECB cut its refinancing rate by 0.25 of a percentage point to 0.25%. While a small group of banks had expected a cut in interest rates, most economists surveyed in a Wall Street Journal poll predicted the central bank would leave rates unchanged.
"The ECB has managed to catch markets by surprise," said Andrew Wilkinson, a strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. "They went straight for the jugular."
The news sent the euro skidding to a seven-week low against the dollar since a rate cut reduces the yield that investors can get on euro-denominated assets.
Also helping the dollar were data showing the U.S. economy grew 2.8% in the third quarter, exceeding the 2% growth expected by economists. The positive data reinforced speculation that the Federal Reserve could begin reducing its postcrisis stimulus program as early as December. The Fed's next move will hinge closely on the October jobs report, which is due for release Friday.
BONDS
U.S. Treasurys ended a wild session with solid gains as investors looked past strong U.S. economic growth data and turned their focus over to the upcoming labor market report and its implications for the Federal Reserve's next move.
In its first reading of gross domestic product for the past quarter, the Commerce Department reported the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.8%, a quicker pace than the 2% that economists had expected. The growth in the July-through-September quarter also exceeded the 2.5% growth in the second quarter and marked the fastest rate of growth in a year.
The report came as a surprise to the market as it indicated the economy was gaining traction going into the 16-day partial government shutdown that began Oct. 1.
But analysts quickly noted the 2.8% growth was driven largely by a big increase in private-sector inventories, which bodes ill for growth in future quarters. Stripping out private inventories, the real final sales clocked 2% growth during the third quarter, a slight deceleration from the previous quarter's 2.1%.
"It looks nice and shiny on the surface. But once you peel back the exterior, you will see a big bump in inventories," said Jeff Cleveland, a senior economist with Payden & Rygel.
Swelling inventories, along with weaker consumer spending and the impact from the budget shutdown, suggested the economic momentum could turn weaker in the fourth quarter.
Nonetheless, Treasurys were sold off in a knee-jack reaction following the GDP report, eliminating most of the early gains fueled by the European Central Bank's decision to cut interest rates at its Thursday's policy meeting.
Bond prices later recovered and floated to session highs, as investors found causes for concern in the GDP report and turned to focus on the Friday's payrolls report for October. The report is expected to help set the tones for the market in the near term, as it's one of the main gauges that the Fed looks at to decide when to start curbing its $85-billion-a-month bond-buying program.
Several reports showed that most traders are short the market, or having bets on Treasury yields to rise. Some traders might have chosen to close out their short positions ahead of Friday's report.
COMMODITIES
U.S. oil prices finished lower under pressure from a stronger dollar, while Brent crude futures slipped to their lowest level in four months amid supply concerns.
Light, sweet crude for December delivery settled down 0.6% to $94.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange declined 1.7% to $103.46 a barrel, the lowest price since July 1.
Early Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that the first reading on the U.S. third-quarter domestic product shows a rise of 2.8%, exceeding expectations. The dollar rallied on the news, sending oil prices lower. Because crude is priced in the greenback, a stronger dollar makes oil more expensive forbuyers using other currencies.
Brent oil futures slid on concerns that ample supplies of crude could increase if more Libyan production comes back online. The country's output sank to a fraction of its normal levels amid labor unrest in recent months.
Traders are also waiting to see whether Iran's talks with six major world powers could eventually lead to the easing of sanctions, which have reduced its crude exports by 1 million barrels a day in recent years.
Gold futures fell after an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank and data showing U.S. economic growth picked up pace last quarter bolstered the dollar.
Gold for December delivery, the most active contract, settled 0.7% lower at $1,308.50 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Dollar-denominated gold futures spent much of the day under pressure from a stronger dollar, which rocketed to a seven week high against the euro.

  Tesla Gets a Flat

    The Shares' Sharp Drop Had Less to Do With the Company's Results Than a Tempering of Investors' Overoptimistic Assumptions of What It Can Achieve

There isn't any problem with the results

reported late Tuesday. The problem is the company's stock price.
Tesla fared better in the third quarter than estimates suggested it would. Its loss narrowed, and the adjusted earnings per share that most analysts use as a yardstick came in better than expected. It delivered about 5,500 cars, more than the 5,000 it had projected and far more than the roughly 250 it delivered a year earlier. What's not to like?
Plenty, to judge by the sharp drop in Tesla shares Wednesday.
The easy answer to why that happened is that although Tesla's results beat analysts' overall estimates, they didn't meet the bullish expectations of investors. Some amateur sleuths tracking Tesla vehicle-identification numbers, for example, thought the company delivered thousands more cars in the third quarter than it actually did.
Even so, it is hard to see why not meeting such Panglossian hopes should hurt Tesla's stock so much.
The deeper problem is that Tesla's rich share price can only be justified on a view that many years from now the company will be profitably selling far more cars than it does now. Just as jiggling a telescope pointed at Jupiter a degree to the right can send you eight million miles clear of the mark, little shifts in Tesla's assumed trajectory can create big swings in its implied value.
Changes in assumptions about the risks of Tesla staying on its trajectory matter, too. Wedbush Securities on Wednesday only slightly lowered its forecast for what Tesla will earn in 2017, to $10 a share from $10.10. But in its valuation model, it also raised the discount rate (which accounts for the time value of money and risks involved) that it is applying to those 2017 earnings to 10% from 6%. That pushed its 12-month price target on Tesla shares to $205 from $245—a $4.2 billion haircut to its expected market value for the company.
Even after Wednesday's drop, Tesla trades at more than 100 times expected earnings over the next year. If Tesla proves itself to be worth half of its current share price, it will have been a phenomenal American success story.

  U.S. Stocks Close Mostly Lower

    Investors Look Ahead to Jobs Data Later in Week

Stock closed mostly lower, but well above early lows, as investors digested a stronger-than-expected reading on the U.S. services industry while looking ahead to key jobs data later in the week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.90 points, or 0.1%, to 15618.22. Earlier in the day, the blue-chip index was down as much as 116.94 points.
The S&P 500 index slipped 4.96 points, or 0.3%, to 1762.97, with energy and utilities shares leading declines. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 3.27 points, or 0.1%, to 3939.86.
The S&P 500, which has gained 24% so far this year, ended the day 0.5% below the record high close of 1771.95 reached a week ago.
"The market is going to send mixed signals in the short term," said Andres Garcia-Amaya, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. "Overall, the data this week has been fairly strong, but the market is confused about if it should like that or not like that," he said.
With uncertainty around when the Federal Reserve will begin scaling back its stimulus measures, investors are trying to manage their expectations for the economic data, Mr. Garcia-Amaya said.
The Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index for October rose to 55.4 from 54.4 in September, bucking expectations for a fall. The ISM Employment index also showed strength, with a gain to 56.2 from 52.7 the prior month.
"The numbers are better than expected," said 



      Peter Jankovskis, 



       co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Ill., which oversees about $3.5 billion. "But the bond market is showing some concern that the Fed might be closer to tapering based on these numbers."
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 2.662%, the highest level in nearly three weeks, from 2.602% late Monday.
Strong data suggest the government shutdown "was more a publicity event than anything else," said Mr. Jankovskis. That means the Feb might be able to begin tapering sooner than expected, he said. Last week, the Fed made no change to its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program at the end of its most recent policy-setting meeting.
Investors also are looking ahead to the first read of third-quarter economic-growth data due out on Thursday and the closely watched October employment report due Friday.
For the next month, that jobs data, as well as consumer-sentiment data, will be key as investors look for signs of how the economy fared during October's 16-day government shutdown, said 



      Russ Koesterich, 



       global chief investment strategist with BlackRock.
"We want to see how consumer sentiment was affected, and how the labor market handled it," said Mr. Koesterich. But the October federal jobs data, which is due out Friday, is difficult to predict, he said. "The data is going to be erratic for a while," he said. "There is a lot of noise around the number."
In corporate news,
tumbled in after-hours trading after the electric-car maker reported third-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue that were above consensus analyst estimates, but not by as much as many investors had hoped. Ahead of the results, Tesla shares had gained 32% since the second-quarter report, and by more than 400% year to date.

rose after the drugstore chain reported third-quarter earnings and revenue above analyst estimates and raised its full-year earnings outlook amid strength in its pharmacy business.

jumped despite third-quarter profit falling 90% on restructuring costs and write-downs related to its Patch local news operations, among other things, as revenue beat expectations. The write-downs are part of Chief Executive 



      Tim Armstrong's



       attempt to transform AOL from a subscription-driven online service into an ad-supported content company.
December crude-oil futures shed 1.3% to settle at a five-month low of $93.37 a barrel, amid concerns over high supplies and potential Fed tapering. November gold futures lost 0.5% to a three-week low of $1,308.00 an ounce.
European markets declined after the European Commission lowered its growth outlook for the euro-zone economy. The Stoxx Europe 600 lost 0.2%, pulling back from a more-than-five-year high on Monday.
The European Commission cut its 2014 economic growth forecast for the 17-nation euro zone to 1.1% from 1.2%, and raised its forecast for the unemployment rate to 12.2% from 12.1%. The European Commission's 2013 forecast was unchanged, with expectations for the economy to contract 0.4% and for an unemployment rate of 12.2%.
The report helped bolster expectations that the European Central Bank could lower interest rates after its policy meeting on Thursday. That kept pressure on the euro, which was on track for a sixth loss against the dollar in seven sessions. The dollar eased against the yen.
Asian markets were mostly higher. China's Shanghai Composite gained 0.4% amid hopes the Communist Party will push ahead with economic reforms. Japan's Nikkei Stock edged up 0.2%.

      Breakthrough

  

  Engineer Mate Rimac Revolutionizes Electric Cars

    The young Croatian built the fastest electric car in the world. Now his innovative designs are being licensed by manufacturers building the next generation of supercars

guides the Concept One—a prototype electric sports car he first designed when he was 21 years old—onto a stretch of road in 



      Sveta Nedelja, 



       a suburb west of Zagreb. The cherry-red vehicle is low, sleek and hardly subtle. Stepping gently on the accelerator, Rimac propels the car to 60 mph in less than three seconds. Jerking the steering wheel, he screeches through a roundabout before returning us to the parking lot outside Rimac Automobili—the Croatian engineer's automotive start-up—where he flings the car into a tight circle, pinning me hard against my seat.
"I'm not showing off," says Rimac through a haze of tire smoke. "I want to show you that the technology is reliable enough to do crazy stuff with an electric car. It's not just something that looks pretty at an auto show. We can build it today. We just need scale."
Unofficially, the Concept One is the world's fastest accelerating electric automobile. The car spreads 1,000 hp across four motors—one for each wheel. As the car turns a right corner, the front right wheel can break for a fraction of a second while the rear wheel generates power. It's an innovation that Rimac, now 25, points to as the "kind of stuff you can't do with an engine," and which defines the Concept One, in his self-confident estimation, as "the sports car of the 21st century."
The official Guinness records for the world's fastest accelerating electric automobile, which hang on the wall of the company's airy white-tiled showroom, belong to a converted 1984 E30
parked in the adjacent shop. Rimac uses the boxy green vehicle as a "test mule" for technologies his company develops. He built that car when he was 19. At the time, Rimac had been winning international competitions for an electronic glove he devised in high school that functions as a keyboard and mouse, and came up with an idea for a car mirror system that eliminated blind spots.
After licensing his mirror invention to a European automotive supplier (Rimac is bound by an agreement not to disclose its name), by 2008 he'd earned enough money to buy the used BMW, which he then began entering into "drifting" competitions (a motor sport in which the car goes into a controlled skid). When the engine blew up after a few races, Rimac decided to marry his passion for cars and electronics. He'd always revered 



      Nikola Tesla, 



       the Croatian-born inventor and electrical engineer, and it occurred to Rimac that an electric motor—a source of instant power, free of cumbersome spark plugs and oil filters—would yield a superior sports car. "It wasn't about making the car environmentally friendly," he says. "The performance is just much better."
It took Rimac six months to convert the BMW into an electric car, using off-the-shelf components. Back at the Croatian racetrack, he was mocked. "What are you doing with this washing machine? Can I charge my phone with it?" competitors joked. Something always broke after each race, but Rimac kept tinkering, designing all the parts himself. The car eventually became "quick enough to whoop a Tesla in a street race," as one auto blog reported. By 2010, Rimac's DIY vehicle was trouncing even gasoline-powered cars.
"At that point, it started to get serious," Rimac tells me. A Croatian businessman approached him on behalf of Abu Dhabi's royal family. They wanted to see a prospectus. "They said, 'We want two cars,' " he recalls. "I was like, 'We're just a couple guys in a garage.' " He set to work on the Concept One.
What began as a hobby then turned, almost by accident, into a business. Today, Rimac Automobili employs 22 people, mostly Croatian engineers (the one non-Croatian employee, the company's head of sales, came from
). Thinking it would be wise to hire someone with actual car-making experience, Rimac Automobili initially brought in an engineer from BMW. But his high salary, and the specialization he'd grown accustomed to from working in the car industry, were not a great fit for the company's start-up culture, where the guy who makes the brakes also orders the parts for it.
"It was a learning curve—we made mistakes," Rimac admits. "But eventually I realized we were doing something right: developing cars for a lot less money than big car manufacturers and managing to beat them in many fields. We have an advantage starting with a blank sheet of paper. There's no heritage that we have to incorporate into the design."
For the first year, Rimac, then 22, hobbled along on a shoestring, helped by some seed money from his father—a shopping-center developer—and the promise of investment from Abu Dhabi. "I sold everything I had just to pay the rent," he recalls. In a superstitious mood, Rimac and his girlfriend, 



      Monika Mikac, 



       the company's head of public relations, concocted a reverse incentive: They vowed to swear off two of their biggest vices—chocolate and potato chips—for an entire year if the company finished a prototype for the Concept One by the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show.
When the Concept One debuted in Germany, the industry took notice: The all-wheel-drive vehicle reaches a maximum speed of 190 mph and boasts an average range of 150 miles on a single charge. The power-to-weight ratio is on par with a Formula One engine. Rimac replaced conventional mirrors with cameras, linked by fiber-optic cables, and added a few other luxury flourishes, like self-closing doors.
Most of the components—almost everything but the battery cells and air bags—are developed in-house. Rather than use molds to make the wheels or pedals, as is typical in mass production, two large milling machines cut parts out of solid aluminum blocks, a costly process that enables the company to adapt quickly to design changes. "Only Formula One cars or spaceships are made this way," Rimac explains. "Nikola Tesla had to go to America to be successful. I wanted to stay here to give young Croatians a chance to work on something interesting."

"If BMW wants to develop a supercar with an electric power train, the best one on the market is from us."

With only one complete commercial vehicle sold to a European car manufacturer, the company was desperate for revenue. What sustains Rimac Automobili is designing and producing various components—electric power trains or battery management systems—for other automotive companies. Recently, Applus Idiada, an automotive engineering company in Spain, commissioned an electric supercar made with the windows and roof of the Concept One but built to different specifications. Rimac has sold batteries to a company that's building levitating trains, and he hints at a breakthrough in the works for "the next generation of braking systems.
"We can design and build prototypes fast and inexpensively, and not just for electric cars. We make chassis, electric parts, molds—all under one roof. But if BMW wants to develop a supercar with an electric power train, the best one on the market is from us," Rimac says. "Our technology could end up in a high-volume product under a different brand. If we had sufficient funding, we probably wouldn't do this kind of stuff. It's a simple matter of survival. 



      Enzo Ferrari



       started to make road cars just to finance his race cars—he did it to pay the bills."
Building a show car to drive business to its engineering services is a strategy that many auto companies adopt, explains 



      Christoph Stuermer, 



       an industry analyst with IHS Automotive in Frankfurt. "Part of Tesla's business plan is to license out other technologies. There are similarities there," says Stuermer.
Looking ahead, Rimac intends to ramp up production of the Concept One, release a new model every two to three years and keep slashing the sticker price. (The car currently lists for $1 million.) He views his target customer as more of a Bugatti or Ferrari enthusiast, rather than a Tesla driver. Indeed, Rimac brushes off comparisons with Tesla, not just because he believes his company occupies a different market, but because Tesla's $465 million in federal loans places the company on an unequal playing field.
Although Rimac Automobili has carved out novel revenue streams, questions over its financing still dog the company. "The government won't help us, banks won't give us loans and there aren't foreign investors in this region," Rimac says. This hurdle is one shared by scores of other electric automobile upstarts operating out of garages and universities: Capital is scarce. Still, Rimac may be able to get by producing a handful of Concept Ones a year, appealing to that niche of customer that manages to keep high-performance automakers like the Italian supercar manufacturer 



      Pagani



       afloat. For now, he can keep eating chocolate.

  Tesla Posts Loss as Output Climbs

    Luxury Electric Car Maker Delivered 5,500 Vehicles Last Quarter

reported a narrower third quarter net loss on higher production but its shares fell sharply in after-hours trading as investors worried the luxury electric car maker's outlook for revenue and profit fell short.
The Palo Alto, Calif., company said it delivered 5,500 of its $70,000 and up Model S electric cars in the three months ended Sept. 30, including 1,000 vehicles shipped to Europe. That was more than the company had projected earlier but below the whisper number of as many as 7,000 cars.
Tesla's shares fell 12% in after hours trading on Tuesday after the company told investors to expect fourth quarter adjusted profit would be similar to the third quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation costs and accounting for Model S leases and "noncash interest expense," the company said it had adjusted income of $16 million, or 12 cents a share, in the quarter.
Shares gained $1.61 to $176.81 in 4 p.m. trading on the
before the release of quarterly results.
Chief Executive Officer 



      Elon Musk



       said the company would continue to increase production over the next several quarters from its current rate of about 550 cars a week. Tesla forecast production of about 6,000 Model S sedans in the current quarter.
Mr. Musk said the company is production constrained primarily because of a lack of battery cells for its battery-powered Model S. He said he expects the company's battery supply to improve next year as a result of a new agreement with


Mr. Musk said that when Tesla begins building in late 2016 or 2017 its mass-market electric vehicle, current production capacity for the lithium-ion batteries won't be adequate. The company is exploring building a battery plant with partners, most likely in North America, he said on a conference call.
"There will need to be incremental production capacity that doesn't exist in the world today," Mr. Musk said. "There will need to be some kind of giga factory build."
Mr. Musk described the proposed battery factory as one that could take raw materials in at one end, and ship finished battery packs from the other end, evoking a lithium-ion battery equivalent of

Rouge complex that early in the 20th century took in iron ore and rolled out finished Model Ts.
The company posted a net loss of $38 million, or 32 cents a share, down from a loss of $110 million, or $1.05 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose eightfold to $431 million from $50 million a year ago when the Model S was just starting to be delivered. Compared with the second quarter, Tesla's revenue was up 6%.
On an operating basis, Tesla lost $30.6 million.

as they report and compare their results with analysts' estimates. Sort by date and industry.
Tesla's gross margin, the profit after product costs, was 24%. The company aims to get to a 25% gross margin by year-end.
Tesla began a leasing program this year under which some revenue is deferred. Tesla said that if it took credit for the total revenue expected from each lease transaction, it would have had revenues of $602 million in the last quarter. Customers leased about half of the Model S sedans delivered in the period, the company said.
The company said it generated record free cash flow of $26 million and ended the quarter with $796 million in cash. It forecast fourth-quarter free cash flow would be about break even.
Tesla said it received $10 million from pollution credits sold to other auto makers during the quarter, down from $51 million in the second quarter.
It plans to deliver about 6,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter and begin deliveries to customers in China in the first quarter of next year.

  Don't Be Shocked if Tesla Beats Forecasts

    Third-Quarter Results Will Give Investors a Chance to Focus Once Again on Fundamentals

It is time for the electrically driven rubber to hit the road.
Plenty of ink has been spilled about whether


shares are in a bubble. Its third-quarter results, due Tuesday, will give investors a chance to step back from that debate and focus once again on fundamentals.
Circumstantial evidence points to surprisingly good revenue. For example, while management said in early August that it expected "slightly over 5,000" cars to be sold during the quarter, amateur Tesla-watchers tracking the issuance of vehicle-identification numbers think it could be far more.
Acknowledging such techniques' unreliability, analysts nevertheless have lifted earnings expectations. Before second-quarter results were released in August, analysts saw a slight loss for the third quarter. They raised this to a two-cent profit after that report and to eight cents recently. On an unadjusted basis, Tesla is seen losing nine cents, compared with a loss of $1.05 a year earlier, according to FactSet.
A big variable in Tesla's performance is payments it receives from other auto makers unable to meet targets California imposes for zero-emissions vehicles. Those are dropping just as more production volume is sending margins higher.
Analysts at
think gross margins without regulatory payments rose to 19.4% in the third quarter, from 14.8% in the second quarter. Including the payments, they are seen declining slightly to 22.8%.
That all bodes well, but the lion's share of Tesla's $20 billion market value depends on future sales of more affordable models beyond today's high-end luxury Model S and planned Model X. The existing lineup, and an entry-level luxury offering slated for 2016-2017, comprises all of Tesla's future earnings that can be reliably projected. Beyond that, margins and volumes are hypothetical.
Even if Tesla confounds skeptics with its luxury models, that will barely move the needle in terms of its expected future earnings. The real payoff lies years in the future and will involve taking meaningful share from major auto makers.
The reason to possibly get excited about a good quarter today isn't the bottom line—it is to gauge Tesla's ability to deliver on those long-term ambitions. But the odds of success are much lower than the company's value implies, no matter if it soars over a low quarterly sales hurdle.

  Warning Signs Flash as Stock Market Soars to Records 

    Some Analysts See a Replay of the Go-Go Market of the Late 1990s

For some investors, it feels a lot more like 1999 than 2013.
Third-quarter earnings have not been spectacular. The U.S. isn't expected to grow at anything close to breakneck speed next year. And there are few industries experiencing huge profit expansions.
Despite all that, a number of high-profile—mostly technology—stocks are soaring. The heady advances are making shareholders of these companies big money, but they're also raising serious questions among some analysts about whether the unusual trading is a troublesome sign for the overall market.
Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average set a record on Tuesday, but closed up just 0.29% for the week. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index also set a record and rose 0.11%.
So far this year, the Dow has climbed 19%, the S&P 500 24% and the Nasdaq 30%.
Some hot tech stocks, including electric-vehicle maker Tesla, entertainment-streaming provider

travel site

and search company Google are doing much, much better. These stocks are up as much as 470% over the past year.
Other soaring stocks include social-networkers LinkedIn, which is up about 110% in the past year, and

up nearly 140%.
The expected initial public offering of Twitter this week likely will add to the frenzy.
Rising stocks usually create smiles on Wall Street, but these gains are also making some nervous.
When a select group of speculative stocks trading at huge multiples of their earnings—due to high expectations for future earnings—leads the market, it can be harder to sustain the gains than in a bull market led by companies with more-dependable earnings.
"It reminds me of the tech go-go years of the late 1990s," says 



      Jack Ablin, 



       chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank.
Indeed, the recent gains in tech shares are reminiscent of the Internet-led bull market that created huge fortunes but ended in 2000 when the small group of expensive technology stocks that had powered the market higher suddenly collapsed, pulling the entire market down with it.
That's not something investors want to be reminded of.
All of the current highfliers are getting investors excited for good reasons, including rapid customer expansions and strong growth prospects.
But many investors have cause for worry, too. Facebook, which reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings last week, nonetheless spooked investors when it warned that U.S. teens are spending less time on the site and that the company might not be able to cram any more ads into users' news feeds.
As for Tesla, shortseller 



      Jim Chanos



       has noted that the company's high valuations—it's trading at a price-earnings multiple of 297 times 2014's expected profits—rest on forecasts beyond 2020 that no investor can reasonably project. Tesla has a market value of more than $19 billion, or close to 40% of the $51 billion value of the much-larger General Motors. But GM is expected to generate sales that are 75 times greater than Tesla's this year.
"It's fascinating to me that today's mini-mania includes shares of Amazon, Netflix and Priceline that have previously peaked and crashed before—in some cases they've peaked and crashed twice before," says Darren Pollock, portfolio manager at Cheviot Value Management. "Stocks like these have again captured the imagination of speculators. We're skeptical that there is enough underlying intrinsic value to many of the highfliers to support today's prices."
Mr. Pollock is also concerned about the rush of companies selling shares as part of initial public offerings.
"You don't see an explosion of IPOs like this at market bottoms," he says. "Bull markets peak when speculation centers around a narrowing number of highfliers amidst elevated share issuances by companies and expanded use of margin debt. We have all three."
In almost every market there are certain stocks that soar, of course. The difference is that those are usually turnaround stories, some with improving earnings, and few are as expensive as today's tech stars.
There are other reasons investors are becoming a bit more cautious. While home prices rose in August from a year earlier at the fastest pace since February 2006, the gains slowed in September—suggesting that prices are peaking.
"Our view remains that national home prices will continue to rise," says Peter Newland of Barclays. "That said, this report may hint at the beginning of an easing in the pace of price gains."
As for third-quarter corporate earnings, they've been respectable—but nothing to write home about. Profit growth remains slow and steady. Third-quarter profit growth among S&P 500 stocks is expected to be about 4.5%, and companies are beating a low bar set by analysts, investors say.
Still, some analysts say the overall market is reasonably priced, no matter how expensive a few sexy stocks appear.
The S&P 500 trades at a reasonable multiple of 15 times expected earnings over the next 12 months. Unlike 2000, the stock market doesn't seem in a precarious position, based on price/earnings ratios and other metrics.
There's "a little frothy speculation around the edges, but overall technicals still remain reasonably healthy," says Mr. Ablin.
"One big difference this time is that nearly 100 stocks of the S&P 500 are making new highs along with the index," he says, suggesting that many stocks are joining in the climb, a healthy sign for the overall market.
Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief U.S. equity strategist, argues that there's a healthier mind-set among investors today than in 2000. He says he's cautious but isn't telling investors to dump stocks.
"I'm concerned that earnings guidance has been relatively soft—there's a real divergence between what the market is doing" and what companies are reporting, Mr. Levkovich says. "And I do see a certain level of complacency, but it's not exuberant."

  Tesla Motors Looking Into Model S Fire in Tennessee

said Thursday it is investigating a fire in one of its Model S sedans that occurred in Tennessee earlier this week. The fire is the third reported within a month involving one of the $70,000 electric cars.
Images of a burning Model S on the side of a Tennessee highway were posted to the Tesla Motors Club website and other websites on Wednesday.
Federal vehicle safety regulators "will contact the local authorities who are looking into the incident to determine if there are vehicle safety implications that merit agency action," the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday.
In a statement, Tesla spokeswoman 



      Liz Jarvis-Shean



       said: "We have been in contact with the driver, who was not injured and believes the car saved his life. Our team is on its way to Tennessee to learn more about what happened in the accident. We will provide more information when we're able to do so."
NHTSA declined last month to investigate a Model S fire that occurred after an accident near Seattle in which a piece of metal punctured the car's lithium-ion battery pack. The agency said it didn't find evidence that the Seattle fire was the result of a vehicle safety defect.
That incident caused a brief swoon in Tesla's stock price.
Tesla shares sold off again Wednesday after the company announced a third-quarter net loss of $38 million and disappointed some investors with its forecast for the current quarter. The company's share price is still more than four times its level a year ago.
Tesla also confirmed last month that a Model S sedan caught fire after a crash in Mexico.

      Elon Musk



       defended the safety of the Model S battery design in a blog post following the Seattle incident, noting that there are about 150,000 fires a year involving petroleum-fueled vehicles. Anxiety about the fire risks of lithium-ion batteries such as those used to power the Model S have been fueled by reports of fires involving laptop computers and a rash of incidents earlier this year involving the lithium-ion batteries installed in Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.

  Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks Mostly Lower

MARKETS AT A GLANCE
SNAPSHOT
A stronger-than-expected reading on the U.S. services industry led to increased worries about a scaling back of the Federal Reserve's monthly bond-buying program, causing U.S. stocks to finish mostly lower, along with Treasurys and gold. Oil fell on worries about increased domestic supplies. Sterling rallied against the euro and the dollar on strong U.K. services-sector data.
OPENING CALL
Wednesday brings an interesting test of investor sentiment on Chinese bank stocks as shares of Bank of Chongqing--China's first bank IPO in three years--start trading in Hong Kong. The small and fast-growing lender raised $564 million last week amid strong interest from institutional investors.
EQUITIES
Stock closed mostly lower, but well above early lows, as investors digested a stronger-than-expected reading on the U.S. services industry while looking ahead to key jobs data later in the week.
"The market is going to send mixed signals in the short term," said Andres Garcia-Amaya, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. "Overall, the data this week has been fairly strong, but the market is confused about if it should like that or not like that," he said.
With uncertainty around when the Federal Reserve will begin scaling back its stimulus measures, investors are trying to manage their expectations for the economic data, Mr. Garcia-Amaya said.
The Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index for October rose to 55.4 from 54.4 in September, bucking expectations for a fall. The ISM Employment index also showed strength, with a gain to 56.2 from 52.7 the prior month.
"The numbers are better than expected," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Ill., which oversees about $3.5 billion. "But the bond market is showing some concern that the Fed might be closer to tapering based on these numbers."
In corporate news, Tesla Motors tumbled in after-hours trading after the electric-car maker reported third-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue that were above consensus analyst estimates, but not by as much as many investors had hoped. Ahead of the results, Tesla shares had gained 32% since the second-quarter report, and by more than 400% year to date.
CVS Caremark rose after the drugstore chain reported third-quarter earnings and revenue above analyst estimates and raised its full-year earnings outlook amid strength in its pharmacy business.
AOL jumped despite third-quarter profit falling 90% on restructuring costs and write-downs related to its Patch local news operations, among other things, as revenue beat expectations. The write-downs are part of Chief Executive Tim Armstrong's attempt to transform AOL from a subscription-driven online service into an ad-supported content company.
Asian markets were mostly higher Tuesday. China's Shanghai Composite gained 0.4% amid hopes the Communist Party will push ahead with economic reforms. Japan's Nikkei Stock edged up 0.2%.
FOREX
Sterling rallied against the euro and the dollar, as further evidence emerged pointing to an economic recovery in the U.K.
The pound rose to a one-month high against the euro and added 0.4% against the buck after data showed the U.K.'s services sector grew at its fastest rate in 16 years in October. Data provider Markit said Tuesday its Purchasing Managers Index, a monthly gauge of activity in the U.K. services sector, rose to 62.5 in October from 60.3 in September.
"The U.K. is doing great, the pound is doing better," wrote Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale, in a note to clients.
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar dipped below $0.95 against the buck after the Reserve Bank of Australia said a lower exchange rate will likely be needed to rebalance the mining-dependent economy. While announcing its decision to leave interest rates unchanged at a record low of 2.5%, the central bank said the exchange rate is "still uncomfortably high."
The Australian dollar's weakness will likely be temporary, however, unless the RBA delivers more rate cuts--something it doesn't appear inclined to do at the moment, said currency strategists at BNP Paribas.
BONDS
Treasury prices slumped after a report showed the U.S. nonmanufacturing sector posted a surprise gain last month despite headwinds from the government shutdown, rekindling investor fears that the Federal Reserve could begin easing back on its stimulus program sooner.
The Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing index increased to 55.4 in October from the prior month's 54.4, while the market had expected a small decrease to 54. The improvement was mainly driven by a solid gain in employment, which increased to 56.2 from 52.7.
This report, along with a strong reading of ISM's October manufacturing index, indicated that the trajectory of U.S. economic recovery remained largely intact during the government shutdown and debt-ceiling debate. "The indications are that maybe the government shutdown is not as impactful as initially thought," said Matt Duch, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Calvert Investments.
For bond investors, if October's employment report, which is slated to be released Friday, shows a resilient labor market, it will revive their fears of the Fed pulling back on its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program and thus drive up yields.
Treasurys were also under selling pressure amid a torrent of new corporate bond issues, as companies are trying to take advantage of the recent slump in interest rates to build up their cash reserves.
"Corporate supply is weighing very heavily on the Treasury market," said Thomas L. di Galoma, co-head of fixed-income rates trading at ED & F Man Capital, estimating that companies will issue a total of $100 billion to $120 billion in debt during November, compared with $60 billion to $80 billion for an average month.
COMMODITIES
Gold prices drifted lower in a quiet trading session, as traders awaited key economic data later in the week that may signal a shift in investor demand for the metal.
Analysts and traders were watching the strengthening U.S. dollar and a weakening euro as a guide to gold's downward tilt, as some investors buy gold as a hedge against inflation. Positive business activity data also weighed, as the Institute for Supply Mangement's non-manufacturing index results were better than expected and reinforced the growing belief that last month's government shutdown was not as harmful to the economy as feared.
The most actively traded gold contract for December delivery ended the day down 0.5% at $1308.10 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, with just over 90,000 contracts traded--less than a quarter than average of daily volumes in the past year.
"Right now it's in no man's land, neither the bulls nor the bears have asserted control at this level," said Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview Financial.
U.S. oil futures settled at their lowest level in five months as traders worried about a potential seventh straight weekly increase in domestic supplies amid weak demand and high crude production.
Meanwhile, a better-than-expected reading on the U.S. services industry led to speculation that the Federal Reserve will soon begin to scale back its economic stimulus program, which has helped to prop up crude prices.
Light, sweet crude for December delivery fell 1.3% to $93.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The decline was the fifth in six sessions for oil futures, which have plunged 16% over the past two months and finished at their lowest price since June 4.
Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange lost 0.9% to $105.33 a barrel. The European benchmark, considered to be a gauge of world oil prices, was supported somewhat by reports of violence in Libya, which has struggled to get its crude production back up to prior levels amid labor unrest.
But most of the trading was driven by positioning ahead of Wednesday's oil inventory report from the Energy Information Administration, due at 10:30 a.m. EST.

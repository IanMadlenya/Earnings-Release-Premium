  Delta Chief Had Long Climb to Top    

    Ed Bastian is focused on building upon a string of successes at the airline

Incoming

Chief Executive 



      Ed Bastian



       ran the New York marathon two years ago after promising he would complete the 26.2-mile race if his airline attained a leading market share in the city.
His path to the top spot has been a marathon as well.
Mr. Bastian, 58 years old, becomes CEO on Monday, 18 years after joining the Atlanta-based company, now the nation’s No. 2 by traffic. In that time he has resigned once, helped steer Delta through bankruptcy and helped shepherd its merger with Northwest Airlines Corp.
Delta is in much better shape now. It has a towering market capitalization of $31.5 billion, is profitable, has little debt and leads in operational reliability. Still, it faces hypercompetition and is vulnerable, like other international airlines, to external events such as the recent terrorist attacks around the globe.
Mr. Bastian tries not to keep “an anxiety list" and is focused on building on a string of successes, he said Friday on the shop floor of an engine overhaul facility at Delta’s maintenance base at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

The executive joined Delta in 1998 as controller but quit in 2004, upset by the company’s approach of using employee concessions to underwrite cheaper fares, he said. The company, with a bloated cost structure and a revenue disadvantage to its peers, had tried to restructure but the effort didn’t work.
“I was very vocal,” he said. “I didn’t agree. I was out of favor in that regard.” So he left to take the chief financial officer post at an Atlanta-based lighting firm. He wasn’t there long. The new Delta CEO lured him back months later, promising him the post of CFO, vowing to hire someone to attack the revenue problem and to be open to bankruptcy.
After he returned, Mr. Bastian showed the same colors he displayed as a young auditor just out of university at what was then Price Waterhouse. He was auditing the books of a large advertising agency, and found something that didn’t look right, he said. He burrowed in and discovered a multimillion financial fraud that others had missed.
“It taught me the importance of really understanding the complex issues,” he recalls. Partners were fired and he was deposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. “A lot of people would have been happy if I didn’t speak up,” he recalled.
That doggedness and intellect brought him to the attention of higher-ups, and Mr. Bastian was made a partner there at the age of 32. He subsequently worked in finance at

Frito-Lay unit for six years before looking around for other jobs.
“I thought the challenges would be much more sizable in the airline industry,” and he was eager to run his own plays.
The 6-foot, two-inch executive said his return to Delta offered many plays. The company filed for chapter 11 two months later, terminated its pilots’ pension plan and cut $5 billion in annual costs. It repelled a hostile takeover bid by US Airways Group Inc. and left court protection in 2007. At that point, the creditors selected a new board.
Mr. Bastian and another Delta executive were the then-CEO’s two top choices to succeed him. But the new board decided to widen the search and seized on 



      Richard Anderson, 



       a former Northwest Airlines CEO and new board member. The other executive departed, but Mr. Anderson asked Mr. Bastian to stay and become president, a new role.
Mr. Anderson’s selection “was not a big disappointment,” Mr. Bastian said, because he “was a lot more qualified.” For the next nine years, they worked as a team and “there was never a rivalry between us,” Mr. Bastian said.
He and Mr. Anderson negotiated the 2008 acquisition of Northwest. Since then, they have expanded Delta’s international network, created hubs in New York and Seattle, drastically improved the company’s operational reliability and returned billions of dollars to shareholders.
When Mr. Bastian steps into his new job, Mr. Anderson, who turns 61 on Monday, will become executive chairman. The new CEO said there isn’t an immediate crisis to focus on. “When things are going well, we actually get a little uncomfortable,” he said. But he thinks he is ready. “I do like a challenge,” he said. “I have a competitive streak in me.”
After Delta purchased a 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. in late 2013, Messrs. Anderson and Bastian went to Necker Island, a Caribbean isle owned by 



      Richard Branson, 



       who holds a 51% stake in the U.K. airline. Mr. Bastian and Virgin Atlantic’s new CEO, 



      Craig Kreeger, 



       played a four-man basketball game with two young Virgin Atlantic executives. “Ed and I were a pretty good team,” Mr. Kreeger said. “The two old guys who could barely move managed to get the ball into the hoop often enough to win.”
Sometimes Mr. Bastian competes against himself. In 2008, he told his team he would run the New York marathon if the airline met its goals in that city. “Sure enough, in 2013, we hit it,” he said. So he hired a coach and started running. An avid golfer and skier, Mr. Bastian said he found the training “hard but manageable.”
Weather for the 2014 marathon was cold and windy and he said he doubts he would ever do it again. But he raised $400,000 for one of his favorite charities. Perhaps even better, Mr. Bastian said: “I beat Tiki Barber,” the former New York Giants running back.

/By   Charley Grant/May 10, 2016 11:31 a.m. ET/Markets
            

            
              Heard on the Street
            



      

    


  

  Tesla: The Cost of Elon Musk’s Model 3 Vision   

    Elon Musk’s electric ambition could turn into a problem for Tesla shareholders

Dreams of an electric future have historically mattered much more to Tesla Motors shareholders than current business reality. But Tesla’s
and
could yet flip that script.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has said he would like to retire on Mars, is certainly no stranger to big promises. And last week Mr. Musk made arguably his boldest claim yet: The electric-car pioneer will deliver 500,000 new cars in 2018, and 1 million by 2020, bolstered by the coming Model 3 mass-market vehicle. That timeline is
than what the company had previously communicated.
Bulls who have believed in the Tesla story cashed in. The company’s debt-adjusted market value has surged exponentially since its 2010 initial public offering. Cash from luxury-vehicle sales, the plan went, would fund vehicles priced for a mass-market consumer. This would generate huge profits for the company, revolutionizing the automobile industry on the way.
Tesla’s rise didn’t occur entirely as planned. The profitability hasn’t materialized yet. Cumulative operating cash flow less capital expenditures is negative $4.6 billion since the company went public. And
.
Those problems didn’t prevent a meteoric rise in the stock price, for two major reasons: A rabid customer base and exciting early products, coupled with an easy money investing environment, meant Tesla could easily tap the capital markets. Tesla has raised money through equity or convertible debt in every year since 2010, according to FactSet, for a total of nearly $5 billion. And since Tesla was the only meaningful player developing a luxury electric car, production problems didn’t cost the company market share.
But the latest promises have ratcheted expectations significantly higher, and they warrant skepticism. To put the 2018 goal in context, Tesla forecasts 80,000 to 90,000 deliveries in 2016. Even that could be ambitious; the company expects to deliver about 30,000 in the year’s first half. Two years ago, Mr. Musk said Tesla
by the end of 2015.
The new timeline has important knock-on effects. Mr. Musk said Tesla would be willing to build its own vehicle parts if its suppliers aren’t up to the new challenge. That could add still more complexity to Tesla’s Model 3 production. And Tesla announced last week that two senior production executives
the company.
Meanwhile, Tesla
, issued just three months ago, to be cash-flow positive in 2016. Importantly, it also said its new production plans would “likely” require still more capital. Capital expenditures are now likely to be $2.25 billion this year, up from $1.5 billion forecast in February.
In other words, the cash burn will likely grow worse before it gets better. Meanwhile, the stock is priced as if it will perfectly execute on these promises; it trades at 75 times estimated 2017 earnings.
And the pressure to deliver has expanded along with Tesla’s promises. The traditional auto giants are no longer sleeping when it comes to electric vehicles.
The latest sign came last week: General Motors and Lyft will begin testing a fleet of self-driving electric cars on public roads within a year, The Wall Street Journal reported. Several other competitors are also set to launch more reasonably priced, mass-market electric vehicles with driving ranges that could attract customers.
In a way, this competition validates Mr. Musk’s vision. But it also means the rubber could soon meet the road for Tesla’s lofty valuation and stock.

  Tesla’s Losses Widen on Lower-Than-Expected Deliveries

    Vice presidents for production and manufacturing leave, as auto maker looks to increase output

said on Wednesday it would ramp up annual production to a half-million vehicles two years earlier than planned, but the electric-car maker will be doing so without two top manufacturing executives.
The Palo Alto, Calif., company nearly doubled its first-quarter loss compared with the same period a year ago, even as sales of its pricey sedan and sport-utility vehicle continued to climb. Tesla abandoned a plan to generate positive cash flow in 2016 as it pours money into its coming Model 3, a $35,000 and up car that it now says will help it sell 500,000 cars by 2018.
The company aims to start churning out Model 3s in the second half of next year. It has a goal of building a total of between 100,000 and 200,000 by year end.
Tesla has struggled to build its current products on time and free of glitches. Problems with the doors and seat latches on the $81,000 and up Model X SUV over the last six months have dented the company’s image.
On Wednesday, Tesla said two high-ranking executives involved with output—Production Vice President 



      Greg Reichow



       and Manufacturing Vice President Josh Ensign—have already left or will be leaving the company.
Mr. Reichow had been with the car maker since 2011 and had run its powertrain engineering before taking over production. He will stay until a replacement comes on board, Tesla said. Mr. Ensign headed manufacturing and has left the company.
The departures aren’t altogether surprising. Founded in 2003, Tesla has lost a number of executives over the past year as rival electric-car startups and technology companies recruit its employees. Among recent departures: Vice President of Worldwide Finance 



      Michael Zanoni, 



       and 



      Jim Chen, 



       its assistant vice president of regulatory affairs.
“Tesla is going to be hell-bent on becoming the best manufacturer on earth. Thus far, I think we’ve done a good job on design and technology on our products,” Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       said in a conference call with investors on Wednesday. “The key thing we need to do in the future is to also be a leader in manufacturing. It’s a thing we need to obviously solve if we are going to scale and scale rapidly.”
In a letter to shareholders, Mr. Musk reiterated a target of selling between 80,000 and 90,000 vehicles this year. He also said “increasing production five fold over the next two years will be challenging and will likely require some additional capital.”
Wall Street analysts have been closely watching the company’s cash burn, and some have speculated it would need to sell addition shares to finance its production push.
Tesla’s new production goal comes after nearly 400,000 people placed orders for the Model 3, which is projected to go at least 215 miles on a charge. Reservations required $1,000 refundable deposits and produced hundreds of millions of dollars in new funds during the quarter. Those monies helped bolster Tesla’s finances and gave it confidence to pull forward its production plans, officials said.
Mr. Musk, on the call with reporters, estimated Tesla’s 2020 production would be 1 million vehicles. Tesla, however, missed its delivery forecast in its first quarter because of a parts shortage for the Model X and other production issues.
It shipped 14,820 vehicles, fewer than the 16,000 cars it had pledged to deliver. It also borrowed $430 million from its line of credit in the quarter, allowing it to increase its cash balance to $1.44 billion at the end of March.
The company used some of the $1,000 deposits submitted for Model 3 orders to help repay $350 million on its credit line after the quarter ended.
Tesla had promised to start generating cash in 2016, but to ramp up production of the Model 3 more quickly it abandoned that pledge and said its capital spending now may rise to $2.25 billion, up from the $1.5 billion forecast earlier.
Tesla reported a first quarter loss of $283 million, or $2.13 a share, as the lower-than-expected deliveries hurt revenues. On an adjusted basis, Tesla lost 57 cents a share, slightly less than the 58-cent loss average compiled by Thomson Reuters.
Revenue for the quarter rose 22% from a year earlier to $1.15 billion and its gross margin declined, excluding the $57 million it was paid for selling pollution credits to other car makers.
Shares of Tesla rose 3.1% to $229.50 in afterhours trading on Wednesday, after slipping 4.2% at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

  Salesforce’s Marc Benioff Has Kicked Off New Era of Corporate Social Activism

    On social issues such as gay rights, Mr. Benioff is pushing companies to speak out, drawing brickbats from local lawmakers; ‘a corporate bully’

When North Carolina passed its law in March restricting certain gay rights, 



      Marc Benioff



       was ready with his rapid-deployment response.
The

chief executive blasted out tweets criticizing the law. He called on other CEOs to speak out and dispatched staff to work with state officials and rights groups. Under pressure from many quarters,

It was the kind of show of force that has made Mr. Benioff a master promoter in the movement toward social activism among American chief executives, one that’s increasingly influential despite resistance from those in its focus and some disquiet from Salesforce’s investors and directors.
“Marc rallies CEOs when business and trade groups are much slower to act, particularly on noneconomic issues,” says

chief 



      Andrew Liveris, 



       who weighed in against the North Carolina law and says Mr. Benioff’s influence led him to get personally engaged in social activism.
The 51-year-old Mr. Benioff earlier this year helped push
that would have let faith-based organizations decline services or fire employees over religious beliefs after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that backed same-sex marriage. Last year, he and other CEOs were instrumental in persuading
. He is now pressing cohorts to back measures to close the gender pay gap.
Mr. Benioff is among CEOs of companies, including



,

,

and

, that have begun pressuring lawmakers on social issues, often with a warning: Change laws or risk losing business.

Marc rallies CEOs when business and trade groups are much slower to act, particularly on noneconomic issues.

That is a departure from the past, when U.S. CEOs often avoided weighing in on social issues lest they incur backlash from shareholders, customers and other constituents.
Now, the risk may be in not speaking up. “Our jobs as CEOs now include driving what we think is right,” says Bank of America CEO 



      Brian Moynihan.



       “It’s not exactly political activism, but it is action on issues beyond business.”
Critics of the new outspokenness include North Carolina Lt. Gov. 



      Dan Forest.



       “The Salesforce CEO is a corporate bully,” says Mr. Forest, who vows to stand with his governor against business backlash. “One or two executives from San Francisco call their buddies, and then we’ve got leftist groupthink tarnishing North Carolina.”
Mr. Benioff says he was once a Republican and now doesn’t formally affiliate with either party. While some in his camp are liberal-leaning, others aren’t. They have pitted themselves largely against GOP legislators.
Some CEOs have told Mr. Benioff they can’t join the cause, with one saying it would put “a target on my back.”
At Salesforce’s annual shareholder meeting last year, an investor criticized Mr. Benioff’s public posture as polarizing and time-consuming. Retired Gen. 



      Colin Powell, 



       a Salesforce director, says he recently advised Mr. Benioff that his advocate persona may subject him and Salesforce to unwanted scrutiny.
“Be careful how far you climb up the tree,” he says he told Mr. Benioff, “it will expose your backside.”
CEOs have long sought to influence policy broadly through campaign contributions. Mr. Benioff and his wife have made $1.3 million in political contributions over the past decade to Democrats and Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. They gave to 



      George W. Bush’s



       presidential campaigns and recently held a fundraiser for 



      Hillary Clinton.


Howard Schultz



       has advocated for tougher gun control. Koch Industries’ 



      Charles Koch



       supports free-market causes, deregulation and criminal-justice overhaul.
What sets apart the new activist CEOs is how they use their names and corporate muscle to campaign directly against specific laws governing social issues, often on short notice, sometimes by threatening to withhold business. These days, a principal cause is gay and transgender rights.
The move took off early in Silicon Valley, where there has long been a mix of liberal and libertarian leanings. Millennial employees “don’t want to focus just on making great technology,” says 



      Susan Wojcicki, 



       CEO of Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube and a Salesforce director, “but also on making the world a better place.”
To attract promising young employees in many parts of America and to woo today’s customers, the argument goes, companies must project a corporate ethos that goes beyond profit. “The next generation of CEOs must advocate for all stakeholders—employees, customers, community, the environment, everybody,” Mr. Benioff says, “not just for shareholders.”
Mr. Benioff’s corporate bully pulpit is enabled by
that keep most investors from questioning his extracurricular activities. Salesforce shares have risen roughly ninefold in the past decade.
“Marc may be distracted on
or at charity functions,” says UBS Group AG software analyst Brent Thill, “but it comes back as a halo around Salesforce, and he’s built a strong team so he’s no longer needed for operational details.”
A San Francisco native, Mr. Benioff worked at

In 1999, he co-founded Salesforce, a pioneer in selling subscriptions to software that businesses can run online rather than storing it on their own computers, part of what came to be called cloud computing. His Salesforce stock is valued at about $3 billion.
An imposing 6’ 5”, he favors bespoke Berluti suits or custom Christian Louboutin “Cloud Walkers” sneakers with his Tommy Bahama floral shirts. At their three San Francisco houses and Hawaiian estate, he and his wife, Lynne, have hosted friends to private concerts by 



      Stevie Wonder, 



      Neil Young



       and 



      Lenny Kravitz.



       He housed 30 Buddhist monks from France recently while their spiritual leader, 



      Thich Nhat Hanh, 



       received medical care at Mr. Benioff’s expense.

Marc Benioff is the ringleader for big-business CEOs...who use economic threats to exercise more power over public policy than the voters who use the democratic process.

He is a prominent presence in the Bay Area, contributing nearly $300 million to University of California San Francisco, including to the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospitals. He touts his new headquarters, under construction, as the tallest building west of the Mississippi.
Mr. Benioff used this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, as an advocacy venue, holding a gathering in a dome overlooking the Alps featuring musicians 



      Bono



       and will.i.am. “Marc wanted to fertilize the interest of CEOs in the U.S., where this kind of political involvement is much newer” than in Europe, says
PLC chief 



      Paul Polman, 



       who met with him there and favors having companies focus on social issues such as food security.
Mr. Benioff honed his activist tactics last year when
permitting businesses to discriminate against gay and transgender people. Salesforce is a large employer in Indiana, where its workers demanded Mr. Benioff act. “Initially, I was very hesitant,” he says. “What do I know about this?”
He identified one weapon in Twitter, which he had used mainly to tweet about Salesforce’s business. When Indiana Gov. 



      Mike Pence



       signed the measure, he sent tweets saying Salesforce would reduce investments in the state and offering to relocate Indiana employees.
Another weapon was his client list. Not only did he have CEO friends but he also could reach his 150,000 business customers. He emailed dozens of CEOs and lobbied others over dinner, including

Jeremy Stoppelman, 



       who says Mr. Benioff helped persuade him to come out against the law.
“He creates air cover for the rest of us,” Mr. Stoppelman says, “so we feel OK about speaking out.”
Eventually, CEOs he contacted—and others at companies such as

and Nascar—came out against antigay discrimination. Mr. Benioff personally phoned Mr. Pence. After widespread national backlash, the governor revised the bill. Mr. Pence declined to comment.
He applied his newfound tactics early this year on Georgia, whose general assembly approved its bill that let organizations discriminate against same-sex couples on religious grounds. Mr. Benioff tweeted suggesting he might cancel his huge marketing conference in Atlanta and dispatched legal and government-relations staff to lobby Gov. 



      Nathan Deal’s



       aides.
And he began the CEO-arm twisting.
He invited chiefs in March to a six-course sushi dinner at his house overlooking San Francisco Bay, interspersing them with tech billionaires and celebrities including magician 



      David Blaine, 



       to urge them to act against the Georgia law. He emailed corporate chiefs asking them to tweet that “There is an economic consequence to discrimination.”
He buttonholed Apple CEO 



      Tim Cook



       at Vanity Fair’s Academy Awards party, asking him to discuss the Georgia law, which Apple later criticized publicly. He emailed Disney CEO 



      Robert Iger, 



       who had notified the governor his company was considering not filming in the state, says a Disney spokeswoman.
When
, Mr. Benioff committed to keeping his conference in Atlanta. A spokeswoman for Gov. Deal, without saying whether Mr. Benioff influenced the decision, says “the governor heard opinions from those on all sides of the issue.”
Mr. Benioff’s rapid-response strategy irked 



      Josh McKoon, 



       the state senator who sponsored the original bill. “Marc Benioff is the ringleader for big-business CEOs,” he says, “who use economic threats to exercise more power over public policy than the voters who use the democratic process.”
Mr. Benioff then turned his guns on North Carolina’s law that limits antidiscrimination protections for lesbians, gays and transgender people and includes provisions requiring everyone to use public bathrooms based on birth sex.
This time, he wasn’t doing all the calling. Companies approached him and his staff for advice. North Carolina’s Democratic Attorney General 



      Roy Cooper



       called Salesforce to discuss the law, which had drawn
. Mr. Cooper “looked to Salesforce because he wanted them to know that this is not who North Carolina is, and that we are fighting against this discriminatory law,” says Megan Jacobs, deputy campaign manager for Mr. Cooper, who is challenging Gov. McCrory for the governorship.
Mr. Cooper on March 29 refused to defend the state law, saying in a news conference that it “will set North Carolina’s economy back.”
Salesforce had little presence in North Carolina, so Mr. Benioff turned to Mr. Moynihan, CEO of Charlotte-based Bank of America, the state’s biggest employer. Mr. Moynihan then weighed in against the law. “I respect Marc,” Mr. Moynihan says, “but it was our headquarters, and we did it for our teammates.”
In an early-April business meeting with Salesforce customer

, which has a 900-person North Carolina office, Mr. Benioff discussed the law with its co-chief executive, 



      John Cryan.

It’s high risk for CEOs to show selective outrage against North Carolina...They will soon recognize the complexity of wading in too quickly into social issues where a great disconnect exists between the corporate suites and Main Street.

On April 12,
to add 250 North Carolina jobs while any of the law stayed intact. Later that day, Gov. McCrory sought to modify some of the law’s components but not the bathroom provision. Deutsche Bank hasn’t changed its plans.
In April, more than 100 chief executives had signed a letter by Human Rights Campaign, the civil-rights organization, and Equality North Carolina, an LGBT advocacy group, protesting the law, including Mr. Benioff, Intel’s 



      Brian Krzanich, 



       IBM’s 



      Ginni Rometty



       and

Mark Zuckerberg.
Some CEOs wouldn’t weigh in, Mr. Benioff says. “I’ve received some very heated emails that joining the cause would be disastrous for their companies.”

Gov. McCrory says “it’s high risk for CEOs to show selective outrage against North Carolina” when they operate in states and countries with similar laws. “They will soon recognize the complexity of wading in too quickly into social issues where a great disconnect exists between the corporate suites and Main Street.”
“We’re not attacking Gov. McCrory or any other politician,” Mr. Benioff says. “We’re protecting our employees from being unfairly discriminated against.”
Mr. Benioff is now also targeting gender-pay equality, an issue that confronted him when Salesforce executives told him many of his female employees were paid less than male peers. He didn’t believe them, he says, but an employee survey showed “I was wrong.” He spent $3 million on salary bumps for about 1,000 employees.
This spring, Mr. Benioff hosted a dinner at the Los Angeles home of actress 



      Patricia Arquette



      —who urged wage equality during her Oscar-acceptance speech last year—featuring Hollywood stars, women’s-rights advocates and corporate executives. Mr. Benioff, who footed the $100,000 bill, says he told CEOs there that correcting pay disparity is “so easy.”
Some disagreed, he says, privately telling him pay was determined by free-market forces. Mr. Benioff surprised

founder 



      Elon Musk



       by asking him for a pay-equality commitment, then handed a microphone to him. “I’ll look into it,” Mr. Musk said, agreeing to consider an audit of salaries.
Mr. Benioff says he isn’t interested in entering politics. At a company meeting last month, an employee asked: “Are you running for office?”
He replied: “I’d be a terrible politician.”

  Fading Oil Rally Keeps a Lid on U.S. Stocks

    Investors have been cautious on risky assets for most of the week

Energy shares rallied Thursday, but major U.S. stock indexes were little changed ahead of a key reading on U.S. employment.
Investors have been cautious for most of the week, questioning the strength of a recent rally amid a gloomy earnings season and tepid global growth.
One sign of investors’ trepidation about the market and economy is that haven assets have remained strong. Gold prices, for example, are up 20% this year, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note is off 0.5 percentage point so far this year. On Thursday, the yield on the 10-year note fell to 1.756%, from 1.786% on Wednesday. Bond prices rise as yields fall.
The monthly U.S. jobs report, which is due Friday, will give investors an update on the U.S. economy and could shape expectations about the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate policy outlook.
Meanwhile, energy shares in the S&P 500 gained 0.7% Thursday as
.
U.S. crude oil breached $46 a barrel, the fourth session in which it has risen above that level this year, but the rally faded throughout the afternoon and prices settled up 1.2% at $44.32 a barrel.
The gains came amid threats to output in Libya, where there is political infighting, and Canada, where several oil-sands companies are shutting down or slowing operations because of fires in Alberta. However, analysts still caution that the rally might not be sustainable, with oil stockpiles hovering around record highs world-wide.
The rise in energy shares wasn’t enough to counter weakness elsewhere, such as in consumer-discretionary companies in the S&P 500, which fell 0.6%.
“There’s nothing good [today] other than the fact that oil prices are higher,” said 



      Ilya Feygin, 



       managing director at broker WallachBeth.
The S&P 500 fell 0.49 point to 2050.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.45 points, or 0.1%, to 17660.71, its smallest gain since November. The Nasdaq Composite fell for a third session in a row, losing 8.55, or 0.2%, to 4717.09.

First-quarter profits for S&P 500 companies are on track to fall 7.1% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet. It would be the fourth-consecutive decline.
That slump could boost stocks later in the year because companies will have a lower bar to compare their results against, said 



      Rob Sharps, 



       a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price Group. But stocks could fall in the near term amid continued concerns about the global economy and weak corporate profits, he said. “I don’t think we’re up and away from here,” Mr. Sharps said.
The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.3% to 332.86. Optimism over oil’s early rally outweighed news of a slowdown in growth in China’s services sector.

  Tesla Earnings: It’s All About the Dream   

    Company's earnings came with more ambitious goals, but investors have to stay focused on the fundamentals

Enthusiasm for the Model 3 mass-market car has powered

Tesla reported revenue of $1.15 billion and an adjusted loss per share of 57 cents Wednesday. That narrowly topped consensus expectations.
But, expectations for the future, rather than current performance, tend to dictate what eventually happens to stock prices. That is especially true for Tesla.
Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk,

More ambitious goals should be great news, but the new plan deserves thorough scrutiny. Meeting production deadlines has never been Tesla’s strong suit. Quality

Mr. Musk also said the new goal “will likely require additional capital.” He added that 2016 capital expenditures will likely be 50% higher than the previous guidance of $1.5 billion. This marks an abrupt reversal, since Tesla said it wouldn’t need to raise additional capital back in February. Tesla’s

And, as always, at more than 50 times projected 2018 earnings, Tesla shares are priced for perfection.
Hope for a bright future still drives the stock. That hope will be put to the test—and soon.

Of course, there are trade-offs: buttons that will give your thumbs a workout, low-quality cameras and limited Web browsers.

  Tesla Is Heading Straight for a Speed Trap   

    On the supposed long-term road to success, Tesla bulls face a harsh short-term reality, likely evident in Wednesday’s quarterly results

Fundamentals are so overrated.
For three years and counting,

has repeatedly overshadowed, well, everything.
Mostly irrelevant.
No problem.
They won’t happen again, of course.
Tesla’s stock has surged more than 500% since 2013 behind a visionary,
, leader in 



      Elon Musk



       and a cultlike investor following. But on this supposed long-term road to success, Tesla bulls face a harsh short-term reality.
Tesla has reported years of losses and has burned through billions of dollars. The hope is that the new, shiny and more affordable
, unveiled earlier this year but not expected to ship until late 2017, will reverse those trends.
Until then, quarterly results, including Wednesday’s release, won’t be pretty.
Analysts polled by FactSet estimate Tesla’s first-quarter adjusted loss widened to 60 cents a share from a loss of 36 cents a year earlier. Revenue is expected to have increased by 45% to $1.6 billion. First-quarter deliveries were 1,180 lower than expected because of problems launching the Model X and disappointing Model S sales.
Investors, though, are focused on the Model 3. Mr. Musk said it received 325,000 preorders in the first week alone, which
That has since risen to nearly 400,000.
Yet what gets significantly less attention is Tesla’s underlying financial condition. It burned through $2.9 billion over the past six quarters, ending last year with $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents. That is less than the $1.5 billion in capital expenditures it expects in 2016. Tesla says it won’t need to raise money. Perhaps the $400 million float from Model 3 deposits can help bridge the gap.
Analysts don’t expect operating cash flow minus capital expenditures to be positive until 2018 at the soonest. That is despite Tesla touting last quarter a new and more optimistic “core operational cash flow” metric.
Tesla, the company, is disrupting the U.S. auto industry. But Tesla stock, trading at a nosebleed 130 times projected earnings over the next 12 months, looks like an accident waiting to happen.

  SpaceX Lands Rocket on an Ocean Platform a Second Time

    Landing followed successful launch of a Japanese communications satellite

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.—For the second month in a row, the aerospace upstart SpaceX landed a rocket on an ocean platform early Friday, this time following the successful launch of a Japanese communications satellite.
A live web broadcast showed the first-stage booster touching down vertically in the predawn darkness atop a barge in the Atlantic, just off the Florida coast.
during a space station supply run for NASA. That was the first successful landing at sea for SpaceX, which expects to start reusing its unmanned Falcon rockets as early as this summer to save money and lower costs.

“May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar,” he added in a tweet.
Musk said this was a three-engine burn for the booster’s return, “so triple deceleration from the last flight.” Before liftoff from Cape Canaveral, he put the chances of a successful touchdown at “maybe even” because the rocket was coming in faster and hotter than last time.
Musk contends rocket reusability is

  Two Electric-Car Charging Companies Land Big Investments   

    NRG Energy’s EVgo and ChargePoint land multimillion-dollar investments

Two electric-car charging companies have landed multimillion-dollar investments as Tesla Motors Inc. and General Motors Co. outline new moves to significantly expand their electric-vehicle strategies.
Vision Ridge Partners LLC said Thursday it has acquired a majority stake in NRG Energy Inc.’s EVgo charging business for $50 million. EVgo is building a network of fast-charging stations in cities across the country. Vision Ridge will pay NRG $19.5 million and invest the rest in EVgo.
The announcement comes a day after ChargePoint Inc., which currently has the world’s largest electric-car charging network, said it received $50 million in a recently completed funding round. The Campbell, Calif.-based company has raised more than $164 million since its start in 2007. ChargePoint operates 28,000 charging locations throughout North America, while EVgo has about 665 stations in the U.S.
“There are strong signals coming from the electric car market,” Reuben Munger, managing partner of Vision Ridge, said. “Sales have continued to hold up despite low gas prices. You are seeing the advent of longer-range vehicles and, with the Tesla layer, there is more volume coming out.”
Tesla said Wednesday it was stepping up its production plans and now plans to build 500,000 of its electric vehicles in 2018 rather than 2020. Meanwhile, GM and Lyft Inc.
on public roads within a year, a Lyft executive said. The Bolt is an electric car that launches later this year and promises to go 200 miles on a full charge.
Lyft expects drivers to increasingly use of the Bolt at its rental hubs. Currently, GM and Lyft rent the Chevy Equinox to drivers who need vehicles in Chicago. That program will expand to more cities and lean heavily on the Bolt.
Despite the electric-vehicle buzz, sales remain small. Electric and hybrid-electric vehicles account for less than 2% of the vehicles sold in the U.S., according to Edmunds.
Still, that hasn’t slowed some states like California from preparing for an electric-vehicle world. The state’s energy commission last month approved nearly $9 million in grants for the installation of fast-chargers along major freeways and highways. The grants went to four companies including EVgo and ChargePoint Inc.

  Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks Give Up Gains

MARKETS AT A GLANCE:
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT:
U.S. stocks gave up their earlier gains and ended little changed Thursday as sharp rallies in the oil market and energy shares faded. U.S. government bonds strengthened for a third consecutive session as investors are cautious over a key jobs report due on Friday. Gold settled lower, giving up earlier gains amid a stronger dollar.
OPENING CALL:
ING analysts advise a short NZD/USD position as a top pick “for those wanting to position for an upside surprise in U.S. wages,” in Friday’s U.S. jobs data. Its preference is to buy a 2-day NZD put/USD call, with a strike at $0.6870 (spot reference at $0.6902, compared with $0.6892 currently), costing 0.34% of notional. “Risks of a positive wage inflation surprise points to USD upside against more rate-sensitive currencies such as EUR, JPY and NZD,” ING says. It says short GBP/USD should also be considered under this outcome. Although ING expects headline payrolls to be slightly softer than expectations at around +190,000, it says “the odds of a positive wage growth surprise are slightly higher.”
EQUITIES:
U.S. stocks gave up their earlier gains Thursday afternoon as sharp rallies in the oil market and energy shares faded.
Investors have been cautious about risky assets for most of the week, questioning the strength of a recent rally amid a gloomy earnings season and tepid economic data. While stocks have recovered from their mid-February lows, gold and bond prices continue to suggest investors’ concerns about weakness in the global economy.
Investors are awaiting a key reading on reading of the U.S. economy – the monthly employment report -- which is due out Friday.
Six of the 10 S&P 500 sectors fell Thursday. Energy shares in the index gained 0.7%, while heath care companies rose 0.4%.
“There’s nothing good [today] other than the fact that oil prices are higher,” said Ilya Feygin, managing director at broker WallachBeth.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.5 points, less than 0.1%, to 17661, after earlier rising as much as 85 points. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2%, while the S&P 500 edged down fractionally.
“Conviction on anything is very low,” said David Hussey, a managing director at Manulife Asset Management. U.S. stocks have become more expensive in valuation terms recently, and the prospect of higher interest rates leaves the market vulnerable to a correction, Mr. Hussey added.
Consumer discretionary stocks fell more than the broader market. L Brands fell 12% after the Victoria’s Secret parent reported lower sales growth than expected, making it the company the biggest laggard in the S&P 500. Tesla Motors dropped 5% after the electric-car maker said late Wednesday its first-quarter loss doubled from a year ago.
Trading in Asia was lackluster on Thursday, amid growing skepticism that a multiweek rally can extend further.
FOREX:
The dollar rose against the euro and yen, as traders reeled in bets against the currency ahead of key U.S. employment data.
The euro was recently down 0.7% at $1.1405. The dollar was up 0.2% against the yen at ¥107.27.
Investors have bet heavily against the dollar in recent weeks, after the Federal Reserve signaled it was in no hurry to raise interest rates in coming months. A strong U.S. jobs number on Friday could bolster the case for the Fed to take a more hawkish view on tightening monetary policy.
Expectations of higher rates tend to boost the dollar, as rising borrowing costs make the U.S. currency more attractive to investors seeking yield.
Friday’s data “could make or break the case for a June rate increase,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange. “Nobody wants to be caught short going into this number.”
At the same time, the dollar fell against the currencies of commodity producing countries, following a sharp rise in oil prices.
The Australian dollar was up 0.1% at $0.7463. The dollar fell 1.2% against the Russian ruble to 65.78, and gave up 0.4% against the Brazilian real, to 3.5353.
BONDS:
U.S. government bonds strengthened for a third consecutive session, sending down the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to near its 2016 low, as investors are cautious over a key jobs report due on Friday.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 1.756%, compared with 1.786% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.
Bond yields rose in April after their sharp decline during the first quarter as anxiety over the global growth dialed back. But yields have fallen again in May as some economic releases out of China, the U.S. and Europe have been disappointing. U.S. stocks’ march toward a record high has stalled. Crude oil prices have also pulled back from their 2016 peak set in late April.
“Yields have been slowly grinding lower again,” said Jason Evans, co-founder of hedge fund NineAlpha Capital LP in New York. “You still have this backdrop of low growth, low inflation and global macro risks,” which makes it difficult for any rise in bond yields to sustain, he said.
The yield’s 2016 closing low was 1.642% set in mid-Feb. It is down more than half of a percentage point this year.
COMMODITIES:
U.S. oil briefly reached some of its highest prices of the year as Canadian wildfires threatened a major oil producer, but the rally faded throughout the day with traders still confident of heavy stockpiles.
U.S. oil breached $46 a barrel for only the fourth time in 2016 and the day’s gains have rivaled some of the largest in the last month. The jolt helped revive a rally that has brought oil’s sharpest gains in years, but analysts and traders kept up their warnings of oversupply that has tugged that rally back throughout the week.
Light, sweet crude for June delivery settled up 54 cents, or 1.2%, to $44.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down from gains that had reached 5.2% in morning trade. Brent, the global benchmark, gained 39 cents, or 0.9%, to $45.01 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, down from earlier gains of 4.8%.
The gains came primarily from fear of outages in two parts of the world. Political infighting between factions in the east and west of Libya could destroy the U.N.-created government there and threaten its crude output. And several Canadian oil-sands companies are shutting down or slowing operations because of fires in Alberta.
“Production outages are piling up,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The fires “escalated fast” and are “very front and center” in the minds of traders.
Gold settled lower on Thursday, giving up earlier gains amid a stronger dollar, as investors looked ahead to a key jobs report on Friday that could shed light on when the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates.

  Ford Invests in Pivotal to Soup Up Its Software   

    Auto maker investing $182.2 million in cloud-computing firm

on Thursday said it would invest $182.2 million in Pivotal Software Inc., a closely held software-development tools and services company, another sign of the automotive industry’s drive to beef up its software skills.
The Pivotal relationship gives the car maker access to “really advanced software development methods and cloud tech skills at a speed at which we wouldn’t be able to do on our own,” said Ford Chief Executive 



      Mark Fields.



       Cloud tech refers to the use of a network of remote servers that run applications and store data.
“As we look at tech and software and how it is opening whole new areas for us to provide experiences for consumers, it is important that we get a level of fluency” in software, he added.
The investment in San Francisco-based Pivotal is part of a $253 million round that includes an initial contribution from

and vaults Pivotal’s valuation to $2.8 billion. Ford was a Pivotal customer, and Ford Chief Information Officer 



      Marcy Klevorn



       will join Pivotal’s board.
In March, Pivotal disclosed a partnership with

, Europe’s largest auto maker by sales. That relationship involves joint development of software and mobility solutions at Volkswagen’s Berlin-based Digital Lab.
Ford that same month formed subsidiary, Ford Smart Mobility LLC, and in April released FordPass, a collaboration with Pivotal. FordPass includes a smartphone app that helps users with parking, car sharing, remote access to vehicles and other services. Owning a Ford vehicle isn’t required to use the app, and Ford says that FordPass “aims to do for car owners what iTunes did for music fans.”
Ford is also opening new software labs in both the U.S. and Europe that the company says will be staffed with software architects, engineers and experts in user experience, all using Pivotal’s method of rapidly developing software.
Three-year-old Pivotal is headed toward an IPO but has no date in mind, according to Chief Executive 



      Rob Mee.



       First quarter revenue was $86 million, up 56% from last year, and the company claims annualized recurring revenue as of March 31 of $115 million.
Current Pivotal investors

,
and
also participated in the latest round, taking total funding in Pivotal to about $358 million.
in 2013, taking software assets from both companies. At the time, GE invested $105 million in Pivotal for a 10% stake.
The investment is expected to be completed this month and is subject to regulatory approval.
The Pivotal investment is also a coup for Microsoft Corp., which runs Pivotal software, called Cloud Foundry, on its Azure cloud. Ford in January struck a partnership with Amazon, Microsoft’s chief competitor for Azure, to let drivers control lights, thermostats, security systems and other parts of their homes from their cars through Amazon devices like Echo.
Microsoft’s other big Azure competitor, Google parent

struck a partnership with
NV on Tuesday to incorporate Alphabet’s self-driving car technology into 100 Chrysler minivans.

  Real Estate for Autonomous Car Facilities Gains Movement in Silicon Valley

    Apple, Google parent Alphabet and several car makers seeking large expanses of property

Apple Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and several car makers are seeking large expanses of real estate in the San Francisco Bay Area for their autonomous-car operations, a top landlord in the area said Thursday, illustrating Silicon Valley’s growing importance in the auto industry.
Victor Coleman, 



       chief executive of Hudson Pacific Properties Inc., told analysts that “we are seeing a definitive movement” from autonomous-car research-and-development facilities, which “seem to be a hot demand item.”
“We’re seeing the Toyotas of the world, the Teslas of the world, BMWs, Mercedes. Ford now is out in the marketplace looking for space,” he said on the landlord’s quarterly investor call. “I haven’t even mentioned the 400,000 square feet that Google’s looking to take down and the 800,000 square feet that Apple’s looking to take down for their autonomous cars as well.”
Such spaces would be large, but car factories tend to be much larger. Tesla’s auto-making plant in nearby Fremont, Calif., is about 5.3 million square feet. Apple’s new under-construction headquarters is about 2.8 million square feet, while Google’s headquarters are about 4.8 million square feet. Both companies lease millions of additional square feet nearby.
Apple declined to comment. Alphabet representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Hudson Pacific is one of the largest landlords in the area, with offices throughout Silicon Valley and San Francisco, where its buildings are home to the headquarters of

and Uber Technologies Inc.
The remarks on driverless cars came as Mr. Coleman was seeking to explain that demand is still strong in Silicon Valley despite concerns about the health of the tech sector. Earlier in the call, he said growth in San Francisco was moderating—a shift in tone that worried some analysts on the call given that tech companies account for a large chunk of the company’s income.
Alphabet has been quite public about its driverless-car ambitions, but Apple has been far more tight-lipped. Apple is in the process of expanding a team that had about 600 employees last year, according to people familiar with the matter.

  BMW Warns of Tough Trading Conditions; Shares Fall

    Luxury auto maker sticks to forecast of improved sales, earnings this year

MUNICH—


warned of a tough business outlook for the rest of the year, citing difficulty in reversing declining sales in the U.S. on top of uncertainty in China and Europe.
The sober outlook sent the luxury-auto maker’s stock price down more than 4% despite BMW’s reporting a rise in first-quarter profit.
The year’s challenges include moderating growth in China, political turmoil in Europe and weakening demand in the U.S., together with heightened competition globally in the premium-car segment, BMW Chief Executive 



      Harald Krüger



       said on Tuesday.
“We expect that the U.S. trend will continue until the summer,” Mr. Krüger said. BMW first-quarter sales in the U.S. fell 11% from the year-earlier period.
Amid a strong shift in the U.S. toward sport-utility vehicles, the German auto maker is now boosting production of SUVs in the U.S. and cutting back on sedans. BMW expects its U.S. business to pick up in the second half of the year.
BMW reported an 8.2% rise in net profit in the first three months of the year despite a slight drop in revenue and a decline in operating profit of its core automotive division.
The auto maker stuck to its forecast for improved sales and earnings this year.
Mr. Krüger had previously warned BMW’s profit growth would slow this year as the company accelerates development of
to compete with budding rivals including



Google, Apple Inc. and mobility-service companies like Uber Technologies Inc.
Some industry experts predict that car companies such as BMW will earn a greater share of their future profits from car-sharing, ride-hailing and other mobility services than from the sale of their automobiles. BMW recently shifted its long-term strategy to take advantage of the trend.
“The decisive factor for us isn't short-term profit but sustainable, profitable growth,” Mr. Krüger said. “From this position of strength, we intend to play a pioneering role in transforming and shaping the world of individual mobility going forward.”
The Munich-based auto maker said first-quarter profit rose to €1.64 billion ($1.90 billion) from €1.52 billion a year earlier. Revenue slipped 0.3% to €20.85 billion, as currency swings offset a 6% rise in vehicle sales.
Earnings before interest and taxes, a key measure of BMW’s operational performance, fell 2.5% to €2.5 billion. The retreat reflected a 1.7% decline in that measure at the group’s automotive division—which includes the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands—and a drop of 18% at its motorcycle unit. The pretax profit margin fell to 9.4% from 9.5%.
In contrast, BMW benefited from an improved performance from its financial-services unit and a lower tax charge.
BMW said in its interim report that earnings growth this year would be “held down by rising personnel costs and high levels of investment in projects that will ultimately safeguard future competitiveness.”
The shift is illustrated by the company’s rising research and development costs. As a portion of sales, BMW’s R&D ratio rose to 4.7% in the first three months from 4.4% a year ago, representing an increase in total R&D spending to €974 million from €926 million a year ago.
Some of that investment will go into technology to lower emissions and meet
in main auto markets such as Europe, the U.S. and China. BMW is investing in improving conventional engines, but is also preparing to launch several plug-in hybrid vehicles and more powerful batteries for its i3 urban electric vehicle.
BMW is also investing heavily in development of
that will be fully self-driving and connected to the Internet that it hopes to launch around the year 2030.
“Our industry finds itself in the midst of a far-reaching transformation,” Mr. Krüger said. “We want to take the lead in the digitization of mobility.”

  Unorthodox Financing Fuels a Tech Dream in China  

    Jia Yueting’s projects include driverless electric concept car, hardware-content ecosystem

When 



      Jia Yueting, 



       founder and chairman of LeEco, launched the Chinese company’s first smartphone in April 2015, many industry observers were skeptical that it could compete against much bigger players in an increasingly saturated market. A year later, amid similar skepticism, Mr. Jia unveiled a driverless electric concept car right before last month’s
. When the car followed Mr. Jia’s voice instruction and parked itself on stage, tears rolled down his face.
“Today, we’re one step closer to our crazy dream,” Mr. Jia told the audience.
The technology industry has no shortage of risk-hungry entrepreneurs willing to bet big on their corporate vision. But even by those standards, Mr. Jia seems audacious—and his ability to draw capital to his vision is a test of the outsize hope some are placing in China’s tech ambitions.
LeEco started as a small, second-tier video website that went public as Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp. in Shenzhen in 2010. It didn’t become well known even in China until early last year, when its share price started a rally that made it one of the most valuable tech stocks listed in China.
Then Mr. Jia’s grand dream of building a hardware-content ecosystem started to get attention. Mr. Jia, 43 years old, is betting that his company can deliver both content—from film and online entertainment to sports—and hardware—smartphones, TVs or cars. The content itself and the experience of accessing it will be so compelling that users will want to use LeEco hardware and pay for its content services, forming an ecosystem. The company changed its name from LeTV to LeEco last year.
Mr. Jia has employed unorthodox—and in some investors’ view, risky—funding methods to fuel his ambition. At the end of 2015, he pledged 85% of his shares, or just under a one-third stake in Leshi, the publicly listed company, as collateral for personal credit lines, according to the company’s annual report. Mr. Jia then lent the money to his new ventures, such as the smartphone and car businesses, the company says. The company declines to disclose the amount of funding Mr. Jia has raised in this manner, but it is believed to be in the billions of yuan. In 2015, Mr. Jia also sold over two billion yuan worth of shares in Leshi and lent the proceeds back to the video site interest-free. LeEco says on average that Mr. Jia pledges around 70% of his holdings in Leshi as collateral for loans.
Trading of Leshi shares has been suspended since early December because the company is working on incorporating its film studio business into Leshi and is expected to make an announcement this week. At the closing price on Dec. 4, investors valued Leshi at 109.1 billion yuan ($16.8 billion) and it traded at 124 times estimated earnings in 2016. Many investors expect that Leshi will resume trading after the announcement.

Mr. Jia said in an interview last year that Leshi’s board of directors disagreed with him on most of his new initiatives so he put his own money behind them. But in the past year, LeEco’s smartphone, sports and cloud businesses were able to raise roughly 9.3 billion yuan in total from outside investors, not including funds from Mr. Jia, according to the company.
Mr. Jia has been able to raise this much funding because China’s easy monetary policy in the past few years has generated abundant supply of capital while many companies and investors are eager to find their footing in the Internet economy. But some investors believe easy money could be coming to an end as China’s debt levels are reaching record highs, and that could put pressure on the financing of Mr. Jia’s empire.
In a written response, LeEco says Leshi’s net cash flow almost tripled last year to 876 million yuan, helped by its healthy growth and loans from Mr. Jia. Its smartphone, TV, car and other ventures have many ways to raise funding so won’t rely on Mr. Jia alone. The company says that Mr. Jia pledges his Leshi shares instead of bringing in financial investors because he wants the company to focus on long-term growth.
It is unclear how investors will react once Leshi shares resume trading. Since Mr. Jia pledged the majority of his Leshi shares for his borrowing, any big slide in the share price could have significant implications, potentially triggering a margin call requiring the executive to sell the shares or put up more collateral to repay the loan. In the written response, LeEco says that the financial arrangement of the pledged shares is very safe and the company has made contingency plans in case of extreme situations.
In entering new product sectors, LeEco is competing with much bigger companies such as smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., e-commerce giant

which has video and film businesses and invested $590 million in smartphone maker Meizu Technology Corp., and search-engine giant

which is developing its own driverless car.
But Mr. Jia aims even higher. At the driverless car event, he said that by making TV, smartphone and now cars, LeEco is challenging global companies



,

Mercedes-Benz, and

“There’s almost zero chance to succeed,” he said, before asking the audience in a Beijing stadium, “Do you think we might have 1% chance?” When the audience answered “yes!” Mr. Jia said, “As long as there’s 1% probability, there will be a miracle.”
But some investors and analysts are concerned that LeEco’s hardware business may take a long time before reaching profitability and scale. According to Leshi’s 2015 annual report, it sold 4.5 million Internet TVs in two years and three million units of smartphones last year. The numbers aren’t stellar, considering that China shipped 437.8 million units of smartphones and sold roughly 40 million smart TVs in 2015. LeEco says it is confident it will be able to sell 15 million units of smartphone and six million smart TVs this year.

  Germany to Subsidize Electric Autos    

    Planned rebate on purchases aimed at kick-starting the sluggish German electric-car market

BERLIN—Earlier this year, a top aide to Chancellor 



      Angela Merkel



       fired a question at German auto chiefs during a closed-door meeting on the country’s most important industry: What are you going to do about Tesla?
The answer emerged on Wednesday, after the German government and the chief executives of


,


and


agreed to incentives to help kick-start Germany’s sluggish electric-car market.
Under the plan, anyone who purchases a new electric car will be eligible to receive a rebate of €4,000 ($4,531) for a battery-electric car or €3,000 for a plug-in hybrid.
The government will provide slightly more than €1 billion to subsidize new electric car purchases and finance expansion of a network of public charging stations. In exchange, car makers agreed to pay half the costs of the subsidies and step up investment in research and development of batteries and other technology.
The hitch: Only electric cars with a price tag below €60,000 are eligible for the cash incentive. That price cap is a bone tossed to conservative critics of the plan who wanted to avoid allowing well-heeled consumers to finance purchases of electric versions of expensive luxury cars with taxpayers’ money.
But it also erects a wall to keep


the U.S. upstart, from gaining a foothold in Europe’s biggest car market with its current lineup of luxury electric cars.
Last year, Tesla’s about $100,000 Model S luxury sedan ranked third behind

Zoe and

Leaf in unit sales of battery-electric cars in the European Union. Volkswagen’s e-Golf came in fourth place and BMW’s i3 city car ranked a distant sixth.
The automobile was invented in Germany and 150 years later it is the country’s most important industry, providing one in every seven jobs and the lion’s share of industry-related research and development. Now, the government fears that

that is leading to the emergence of electric cars coming from Tesla and new players from Silicon Valley and Asia.
It isn’t just electric cars. As German engineers work on developing self-driving cars, big technology firms like Google parent

and

in addition to other car makers, have emerged as competitive threats.
“The reinvention of the automobile is mainly being driven by companies that do not have their headquarters in Germany,” 



      Sigmar Gabriel, 



       Germany’s economy minister and leader of the Social Democrats, told reporters.
Mr. Gabriel, junior partner in Chancellor Merkel’s center-right coalition government, compared the government’s decision to support development of electric cars with moves in the 1960s to create

the European maker of large jetliners, to protect aviation jobs and prevent the U.S. from building a monopoly.
“Back then, we provided massive assistance,” he said. “And today we are in a similar situation.”
Production of the most important component in the electric vehicle, the battery, is dominated by large Asian manufacturers such as

Tesla, which only began making cars a few years ago, has become the most respected brand in the new electric car sector. Its battery-powered Model S sedan has outsold Mercedes-Benz’s iconic S-class luxury sedan in some markets.
Now, Tesla is preparing to launch its first mass-market battery-electric car called the Model 3. When the
recently, nearly 300,000 customers paid Tesla $1,000 to preorder the car.
Some analysts see the Model 3 as a more serious threat for Germany’s car makers. With a price tag starting around $35,000 it will be affordable for a larger group of consumers.

      Wolfgang Schäuble

The auto industry lobbied hard. BMW Chief Executive 



      Harald Krüger



       met Mr. Schäuble in his office at the finance ministry in March to press the industry’s case. The enormous response to Tesla’s preorder campaign for the Model 3 melted any remaining doubts about the need for urgent action, according to a person familiar with the situation.
The German plan is nearly tailor-made to stop Tesla. Besides the cap on the ticket price, the rushed timing and limited duration of the plan means it will be over before Tesla’s Model 3 is launched.
“It’s first come, first served,” Mr. Schäuble said.

  Chinese Tech Firms Charge Into Electric Cars

    One entrepreneur envisions selling vehicles like smartphones, with add-ons providing fatter profits

In a four-story Bauhaus-style building west of Shanghai, nearly 500 engineers are working to put what they hope will be China’s answer to a

electric car on the road.
Their company, NextEV, currently doesn’t have anything to sell. It plans to unveil its first electric car in 2017.
“Our goal is to build a high-end, high-performance electric car for half the price of a Tesla car,” said 



      Li Bin, 



       co-founder and chairman of NextEV.
Counting Chinese Internet giant


as an investor, NextEV is part of an increasingly crowded industry as the world’s biggest auto market welcomes a wave of new entrants—China’s deep-pocketed Internet giants. Concerned that
don’t have what it takes to innovate, Beijing has used generous subsidies to encourage tech firms to lead the way as it struggles to cut pollution and reduce its dependence on imported energy.
As well as attracting Internet companies, these auto startups have been backed by private equity, forged partnerships with Silicon Valley firms and hired talent from the global auto industry.
China’s industrial regulator amended rules in June last year to allow nonautomotive companies to invest in the electric car industry. “The auto industry is on the cusp of revolutionary change,” said a senior executive at a state-owned auto maker, who declined to be named because he wasn’t cleared to speak to media. “Beijing hopes that the Internet companies will bring innovation to the industry,” he said.
Created by Internet entrepreneurs including the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant

NextEV is one of nearly a dozen Chinese auto startups that have begun operation over the past 12 months.
Elsewhere, the country’s biggest search-engine operator,

is working on a self-driving car, which it says will hit the road in five years.

are
in a cooling Chinese auto market, but electric vehicles dominated
Tech and entertainment company LeEco, which is better known for its smartphones, televisions and video streaming, showcased a concept self-driving electric supercar. Features include back seats that adjust to passengers’ bodies and a steering wheel that disappears in self-driving mode. It isn’t clear when the car will go into production.
LeEco Chief Executive Jia Yueting envisions a business model for his web-connected cars that would price them in a similar way to smartphones or televisions, with customers paying not so much for the hardware but for content such as TV shows, movies and other services. He sees his cars eventually being free of charge. “We are creating a new ecosystem for future mobility rather than just making a car,” he said.
Turning these ambitions into reality will be tested by increasing competition and doubts about the sustainability of China’s subsidy-fueled boom in electric vehicles, particularly following a recent government probe into several suspected instances of subsidy fraud.
But startups say the game has changed. NextEV has struck a deal with a state-run company to help build its car. “I don’t think it’s difficult to build an affordable, high-end electric car, “ said Mr. Li. “Electric wheel motors and battery packs aren't that complicated compared with internal-combustion engines.”
NextEV has hired more than 700 employees globally since it was formed in November 2014 and has four research centers. Its notable hires include Martin Leach, a former chief executive of Maserati, and 



      Padmasree Warrior, 



       former chief technology officer at


It has received investment from 



      Sequoia Capital, 



       Hillhouse Capital Group and Tencent and raised about half of the $1 billion it is targeting, said Mr. Li, adding that the remaining $500 million will be raised by the end of this year.
Elsewhere, Future Mobility,

joint venture with Tencent, has hired executives from

i-series electric vehicle development team. LeEco has ties with California-based electric car maker Atieva and startup Faraday Future, and cooperates with state-run auto maker


Electric vehicles in China are exempt from certain restrictions facing their gasoline-fueled counterparts. In Beijing for example, a consumer can buy an electric car and drive any day of the week, instead of being banned one day a week for a gasoline car.
But while sales of electric and hybrid cars and buses quadrupled in 2015 from the previous year to 331,000 vehicles, it is a tiny tally in a market where total vehicle sales exceeded 24 million. The surge was largely due to China’s generous subsidies for electric vehicle ownership—the future of which remain uncertain.
Such huge government spending isn’t sustainable given China’s slowing economy and issues with deteriorating local government debt, some analysts say. Beijing has also made it clear that it would reduce subsidies for electric vehicles over time.
Hou Yankun, 



       head of China equity and Asian auto research at UBS, estimates that in 2015 China’s central and local governments spent a total of 90 billion yuan, or $14 billion, in the sector, including direct cash subsidies for electric vehicle makers and construction on public charging stations. Cash subsidies account for more than 40% of an electric car’s tag price, much higher than the 10% to 15% ratio in other markets, he said.
NextEV’s Mr. Li said he isn’t under pressure to make fast money. “Our investors have never set the timetable about when to make a profit,” he said.

for 20 767 cargo planes, Amazon will soon control a fleet of 40 freighters in the U.S. and have significant stakes in both air carriers if it picks up the warrants for stock purchases that come with the jet-lease agreements. The e-tailer’s moves could be a boon to operators that have been laboring through a decade of stagnation in the air cargo business, and Amazon’s impact could grow if its ambitions extend beyond ferrying its own goods around North America. That’s because Amazon may hold enough air capacity to offer competition to parcel carriers FedEx Corp, and United Parcel Service Inc., particularly if the company bundles its distribution operation more tightly with the third-party sales services it offers small retailers.

to defy the global commodities rout.
,” the WSJ’s Stephanie Yang and Biman Mukherji report. China is a big driver of the surge because the country is turning to lithium batteries to power its transportation sector. Lithium-ion batteries are at the heart of electric vehicles, which are grabbing a larger share of auto sales every year, and one expert expects total lithium demand will increase 500% by 2020. Getting the battery-grade material is a logistical challenge, however, since it is found in remote locations. And the growing reliance on lithium will pressure the airfreight industry so solve safety problems connected with handling batteries.

The ability to remain patient is a competitive advantage.

Perhaps more significant for shipping business, the New Orders index fell back 2.5 percentage points, still above the threshold growth but suggesting that companies are looking more critically at bulking up business amid uncertain demand. That fits with comments from several freight operators that reported in the wake of their first-quarter earnings statements that shipping demand eased back in early April. Trucker Saia Inc. said its early-April shipment count was off 4.3% from a year ago, adjusting for Good Friday, signaling a “pretty soft” industrial economy.

  Work begins to move Nikola Tesla monument at Niagara Falls

NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y.  — A monument to inventor Nikola Tesla will soon have a new view of Niagara Falls.
The Tesla statue is being moved to a spot overlooking the American Falls at scenic Stedman's Bluff where state officials say it will be more accessible to visitors. It now stands on Goat Island, in the Niagara River near the brink of the falls.
The bronze statue was a 1976 bicentennial gift to the United States from the people of Yugoslavia.
Tesla invented alternating current and was instrumental in construction of the first hydro-electric plant in Niagara Falls.
Work on the move is expected to get underway this week and should be completed by June. The project is part of an ongoing $70 million revitalization of Niagara Falls State Park.

  Tesla Earnings: What to Watch

    Silicon Valley electric-car maker’s core business in view after Model 3 rush

first quarter results will be released after the bell on May 4.

: Tesla is expected to post an operating loss of 58 cents a share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, compared with a loss of 36 cents a share reported in the first quarter of 2015. Tesla’s first quarter deliveries were 1,180 lower than expected because of problems launching the Model X and sales of the Model S didn’t keep pace with the fourth quarter of 2015. Tesla’s losses have been deepening, and the Silicon Valley electric-car maker has posted only one profitable quarter on the basis of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles since going public in 2010.

: Revenue is forecast to have risen 45% to $1.6 billion in the first quarter compared with the prior-year quarterly performance. Unit sales rose to 14,820 a 48% increase over the same period a year ago. Deliveries are closely watched given the amount of cash needed to run an auto company and the expectation that more scale will aid Tesla’s business.

:

: Tesla’s annual sales goal of 80,000 to 90,000 for 2016 is among the closest-watched metrics for Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk, 



       and the company’s ability to achieve that rests largely on the status of the Model X. The company recently said it is nearing full production of the new SUV, but it has struggled with parts shortages and customers are reporting numerous repair issues with the vehicle.

: Mr. Musk has said the company will reverse cash outflows in the first quarter of 2016, potentially lessening the need to live on borrowed money. The company ended 2015 with about $1.2 billion in cash, which is less than its annual capital expenditure budget. The larger order bank of reservations for the forthcoming Model 3, representing $400 million in refundable deposits, could give the company a cushion, but investors will be focused on the company’s ability to match spending with income.

: Tesla’s ability to amass about 400,000 reservations at $1,000 per slot has indicated the company will see plenty of demand, but it also raises questions. How many of those deposits were multiple reservations from a single person, for instance? Mr. Musk will also be pressed for details on how quickly the company can ramp up production to satisfy customers—currently the Model 3 is projected to cost about $35,000, have a battery range in excess of 200 miles and go on sale sometime in 2017.

: The company’s stationary battery business made a big splash early in 2015, but focus has largely been on Tesla’s core car business, which sucks up most of the capital. The battery business, by most accounts, is moving along and Tesla should be well on its way to delivering packs around the world. It recently stopped taking orders for its 10 kWh stationary storage device, settling on the 7 kWh model instead due to low demand for the more powerful option.

: Tesla’s giant battery factory near Reno, Nev., is closely watched and the company’s previously-disclosed timetable raises questions. Analysts and investors will look for more insight on whether the plant is ready to produce cells, and whether it on track to make batteries for the Model 3.

  GM Executive Credits Silicon Valley for Accelerating Development of Self-Driving Cars   

    Head of GM’s foresight and trends unit says timetable for autonomous vehicles likely moved from 2035 to 2020, if not sooner

A General Motors Co. executive credited Silicon Valley companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google car division and Tesla Motors Inc., for accelerating the development of autonomous vehicle technology and shortening the timetable for when safer self-driving cars hit the road.
Richard Holman, a 30-year automotive veteran running GM’s foresight and trends unit, said Tuesday that three years ago most industry participants would have estimated 2035 as a reasonable timetable for self-driving cars. Speaking to a conference in suburban Detroit, Mr. Holman said now most people see that technology being deployed by 2020, if not sooner.
Mr. Holman noted companies like GM and its rivals have been working on autonomous vehicles for several years, and said tech giant Google and electric-car maker Tesla deserve get credited for moving the industry along.
The comments represent a rare nod by a Detroit auto executive to the influence that Silicon Valley has had at reshaping a global auto industry that large international auto makers have long dominated.
Mr. Holman noted many large auto makers take a more “cautious” view than tech companies—“we don’t want to make a mistake,” he said. Silicon Valley’s participation in autonomous vehicle development “forced the issue.”
GM has aggressively pursued ways to keep pace, investing $500 million in ride-hailing service Lyft Inc. and planning a $1 billion purchase of Cruise Automation, a San Francisco autonomous-vehicle developer. Within a year, those three companies will begin testing electric taxis on public roads,

  Tesla Shakes Up Market for Lithium, Other Metals    

    ‘In order to produce half a million cars a year…we would basically need to absorb the entire world’s lithium-ion production,’ Elon Musk said in March

shaking up the auto industry with its battery-operated cars, is now reshaping metals markets, too.
Tesla and other electric-vehicle makers are swallowing up lithium, a lightweight material that some call “white petroleum” for its use in lithium-ion batteries that power electric cars.
Lithium carbonate prices rose 47% in the first quarter compared with the average price in 2015, according to the most recent available data from data provider Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. In 2015, when most other metals and commodities still were in the doldrums, lithium prices rose 28%, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said.
Orders for the soft metal show no sign of abating. A report from

says lithium demand could triple by 2025 to 570,000 tons, driven principally by smartphone and electric-car applications.
Telsa isn’t the only consumer, but its voracious appetite for lithium is getting significant attention.

that it expects to sell 500,000 cars world-wide by 2018, and its 2020 production would be one million vehicles, thanks in part to its coming Model 3 car. With a price tag of $35,000, it would be about half the cost of the Tesla Model S sedan. The company says it already has received nearly 400,000 orders for the Model 3.
Those orders will require a lot of lithium.
“In order to produce half a million cars a year…we would basically need to absorb the entire world’s lithium-ion production,” Tesla Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       said at the unveiling of the Tesla 3 model on March 31.
Tesla also aims to become the world’s largest lithium-ion battery producer with its factory in Sparks, Nev. One Tesla Model S battery contains more lithium than 10,000 smartphones, Goldman Sachs estimates.
While the Earth’s crust contains plenty of lithium, which is the lightest metal on the periodic table, it is difficult to dig up. Most deposits are in remote locations that pose technological and logistical challenges. There are about a half dozen major lithium-producing resource sites world-wide, spread among Chile, Argentina and Australia.
Unlike gold, copper or many other commodities, lithium doesn’t have a spot market and isn’t traded on an exchange. Prices are negotiated individually through contracts between buyers and sellers.
Much of the demand is coming from China, where the government is turning to lithium batteries for use in electric buses and other vehicles. NextEV, a Chinese company that has said it plans to unveil its first electric car next year, could further stoke lithium consumption.
It isn’t just lithium that is experiencing what some analysts call the Tesla effect. Aluminum demand could gain from a development known as lightweighting, or substituting aluminum for steel to create lighter cars such as the all-aluminum body frame in Tesla’s Model S car.
Demand for copper, which is used as a conductor of electricity, also could rise. An electric car uses 60 kilograms of copper per vehicle, four times that of its diesel equivalent, according to producer Mantos Copper.
“The narrative is changing,” said 



      Bart Melek, 



       head of commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto. “We are headed in the direction where these vehicles are becoming affordable for the mass market. The technology is at a point in time where we could envision this as an ever-increasing factor.”
At the same time, demand for platinum and palladium could ebb, analysts say. These metals are largely used in catalytic converters to filter diesel fuel emissions, and have no use in battery-powered electric cars.
Fuel-cell cars, another new technology that uses platinum as a catalyst to combine hydrogen with oxygen to generate electricity, could boost the metal’s demand but these automobiles haven’t yet generated the same interest as Tesla’s electric cars.
Battery-powered cars and hybrids represent less than 2% of vehicles sold in the U.S., researcher Edmunds.com said, and they remain a long way from becoming mainstream. But Bank of America Merrill Lynch metals strategist Michael Widmer said widespread use of battery-powered cars could deal a devastating blow to platinum and palladium. “There is not much the industry can do on that front,” he said.
Even with voracious lithium demand from electric-car makers, some warn that the metal could eventually fall victim to oversupply issues that often plague commodities when producers rush to catch up with rising orders.
Some industry executives said demand for lithium could remain strong for three to five years. After that, though, the market could tip into oversupply as new capacity arrives.
Graham Kerr, 



       CEO of South32 Ltd., a Perth, Australia-based resources company, said he is wary of investing in the lithium market on the basis of battery technology that is quickly evolving. “It is one of those niche kind of commodities that can be the flavor of the moment today,” he said “But if technology moves a different way, it doesn’t have many multiple uses.”
Some big global miners have watched closely the spike in lithium prices but haven’t decided if the market is deep enough to enter. Lithium demand is about 175,000 tons a year, according to

a Vancouver-based resources company.
“We will watch it...but even in some of the most optimistic projections, it is a relatively small market,” said

CEO Andrew Mackenzie. He said it is a market the world’s biggest miner is unlikely to tap.
—Rhiannon Hoyle and Yifan Xie contributed to this article.


Lithium is the lightest metal; an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it was the lightest element in the periodic table. Also, BHP’s CEO said the miner is unlikely to make a move into the lithium market. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it was likely. (May 5, 2016)

Capable of carrying 1,500 gallons of beer an hour at 12 mph, the pipeline has become a tourist attraction and the mayor, Renaat Landuyt, says he could even consider a pipeline for other precious commodities, like chocolate. “Everyone who proposes alternative means of transport,” he said, “is welcome here.”

  GM, Lyft to Test Self-Driving Electric Taxis

    Move aimed at fighting off Silicon Valley giants amid a reshaping auto industry

and Lyft Inc. within a year will begin testing a fleet of self-driving Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis on public roads, a move central to the companies’ joint efforts to challenge Silicon Valley giants in the battle to reshape the auto industry.
The plan is being hatched a few months after GM
, a ride-hailing company whose services rival Uber Technologies Inc. The program will rely on technology being acquired as part of GM’s
of San Francisco-based Cruise Automation Inc., a developer of autonomous-driving technology.
Details of the autonomous-taxi testing program are still being worked out, according to a Lyft executive, but it will include customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city. Customers will have the opportunity to opt in or out of the pilot when hailing a Lyft car from the company’s mobile app.
In addition to driverless cars, GM aims to use Lyft and its growing army of drivers as a primary customer for the Bolt,
later this year amid soft demand for electric vehicles. The Detroit auto giant and Lyft currently rent the Chevy Equinox to drivers needing vehicles in Chicago, but that program will expand to more cities and will rely heavily on Bolts in the future instead of the sport-utility vehicle.
Because the Bolt’s battery is under the cabin floor, it opens up space in the front of the vehicle and offers back-seat passengers more leg room. GM executives have touted the car as an ideal fit for drivers needing space and lower operating cost.
GM’s effort to rapidly hem together recent big-dollar investments is an answer to the tech industry’s efforts to displace conventional auto makers. Many global auto makers have been lapped by key developments born in Silicon Valley, including


electric cars,


Google autonomous car program and Uber’s ride-sharing business.
The new effort is directed mostly at challenging Alphabet and Uber. The Google self-driving car program has gained a sizable lead over conventional auto makers via testing in California and other states, and it received an additional boost this week through a minivan-supply agreement with

NV. Uber, much bigger than Lyft, has its own self-driving research center in Pittsburgh and is preparing to usher autonomous vehicles in to its fleet by 2020.

We will want to vet the autonomous tech between Cruise, GM and ourselves...

Executives at Lyft and Uber have said one of the top hurdles to their success is navigating a patchwork of regulations that govern the use of autonomous vehicles and liabilities. In an effort to ease regulatory concerns, Lyft will start with autonomous cars that have drivers in the cockpit ready to intervene—but the driver is expected to eventually be obsolete.
“We will want to vet the autonomous tech between Cruise, GM and ourselves and slowly introduce this into markets,” 



      Taggart Matthiesen, 



       Lyft’s product director, said in an interview. That will “ensure that cities would have full understanding of what we are trying to do here.”
Lyft has a prototype smartphone application that would show customers the option of being picked up by an autonomous car. It would have options to contact a GM OnStar assistant for questions or to aid the rider if some problem occurred. The app also allows the passenger to tell the car when to “go” and when he is finished with the ride and the car can leave.
The app is only a prototype at this point, but it speaks to how the company is trying to solve issues of trust with an autonomous vehicle.
Mr. Matthiesen said his company also is working out how to design the program by which Chevy Bolts would be available to prospective Lyft drivers, many of whom can’t obtain acceptable vehicles for taxi customers. “Really the question is: ‘Is it Lyft that owns the vehicles or is it GM that owns the vehicles?’ ” At the Chicago hub, GM owns the vehicles and dealers service them.
Although Tesla has created demand for high-price electric vehicles and has a long waiting list for a car designed to compete with the Bolt in 2017, other auto makers haven’t been as successful, especially as gasoline prices are low. Electric vehicles and hybrid-electric vehicles make up less than 2% of vehicles sold, according to researcher Edmunds.com, and sales to date of pure electric cars like


Leaf generally have been modest.

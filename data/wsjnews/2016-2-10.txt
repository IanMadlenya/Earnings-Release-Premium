  Tesla Earnings: Why They Aren’t Built for Speed   

    Lofty forecasts gave Tesla stock a big boost, but bringing hopes to fruition will be much trickier

An
sparked a sharp rally in Tesla shares after the market’s close Wednesday. But fourth-quarter results suggest

’ race against the clock is actually becoming more urgent.
The electric-automobile upstart reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.75 billion and a loss per share of $2.44. While those figures were short of analysts’ expectations, the stock was nearly 12% higher in after-hours trading.
One reason: Tesla is maintaining its delivery target of 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles this year. Plus, the company said it expects “moderate” profitability according to generally accepted accounting principles by the fourth quarter of 2016.
The upbeat delivery forecast aside, Tesla’s
continued apace. While the company highlighted a seemingly flattering non-GAAP cash-flow figure, the figures investors typically look to weren’t so favorable. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was once again negative in the quarter, to the tune of $441 million.
Tesla now has burned $2.9 billion in the past six quarters and has just $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents left on its balance sheet. Meanwhile, Tesla expects $1.5 billion in capital expenditure this year, although it did say it wouldn’t need to raise any additional cash to meet forecasts.
Investors have long been happy to endure production hiccups and cash burn in anticipation of future riches. But that mentality has been tossed aside as the stock market has soured: Tesla was down nearly 40% this year before the earnings report.
And operational issues become more important given the high stakes for the Model 3 sedan, Tesla’s more affordable car. Tesla still is planning to unveil the Model 3, which bulls expect will lift the company to profitability, on March 31. Vehicle deliveries are expected to begin in late 2017.
Yet competition is intensifying. Chevrolet, to name one, has unveiled a competing product that will be available a year earlier.
The pressure on CEO 



      Elon Musk



       to stay on schedule and on budget—
—is only going to grow.

  U.S. Moves to Boost Ties on China’s Doorstep

    Obama to meet with 10 Southeast Asian leaders to coordinate U.S. interests in region where Beijing is dominant power

JAKARTA, Indonesia—U.S. President 



      Barack Obama



       will meet with leaders of 10 Southeast Asian nations next week in a bid to coordinate American interests ranging from security to trade with a region increasingly sandwiched between Washington and Beijing.
Participants in the two-day summit that begins Monday in southern California will discuss business and trade ties, terrorism and regional irritants such as Beijing’s disputed territorial claims in the South China Sea, U.S. officials said.
The summit, which these people said will be informal and less scripted than a normal summit, come as the U.S. and China, the region’s dominant economic, political and military power, vie for influence among the 10 countries. The meeting will let Mr. Obama showcase the U.S.’s emphasis on Asia, U.S. officials said, without any expectation that the summit with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, will lead to any major agreements.
“This is an opportunity for leaders to close the door and have an in-depth conversation,” said 



      Daniel Russel, 



       U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs. The event is “a milestone in our strategic engagement with Asia, and proof positive that the rebalance has reached cruising altitude.”
The summit will build on previous Obama administration efforts to forge closer ties with the region. Last year, Mr. Obama hosted several Asian leaders in the U.S., and visited the Philippines and Malaysia for regional summits. The U.S. also last year earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars for the Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative to bolster the naval and coast guard capabilities of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.
These countries have competing claims with Beijing in parts of the South China Sea, where China has been building airstrips and other facilities on reefs in the disputed waters.
“For the Asean countries, it’s a clear signal that Asian leaders are increasingly looking to the U.S. as uncertainty about China’s future grows, and are hedging their economic and security risks in the region,” said 



      Ian Bremmer, 



       president of Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy.
Some analysts said the summit could help build support for the U.S.-led, 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, a trade and investment agreement intended to create new rules for global business and strengthen intellectual property laws and environmental protections. The U.S. is already the largest investor in the Asean bloc and one of its biggest trading partners.
Four Asean nations—Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam—are already members of the pact, and others have expressed interest in joining, including the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia. China isn’t a member.
The summit “will be a diplomatic recruiting session, as the Obama administration tries to line up Southeast Asian support for key pillars of the U.S. rebalance,” including the TPP and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, said 



      John Ciorciari, 



       assistant professor at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. “U.S. officials rightly deny that the summit is anti-China, but their counterparts in Zhongnanhai will insist that the U.S. government doth protest too much,” he said, referring to the headquarters of China’s Communist Party.
The retreat will take place at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, where Mr. Obama hosted Chinese President 



      Xi Jinping



       in 2013. After the summit, some Asian leaders, including Malaysian Prime Minister 



      Najib Razak



       and Singaporean Prime Minister 



      Lee Hsien Loong, 



       will travel to San Francisco to meet with tech companies, including



and


Indonesian President Joko Widodo will deliver the keynote address at a conference about the region’s budding Asean Economic Community, an effort to integrate their economies to bring more global sway and prosperity to the region’s 622 million citizens.
The summit is a signal that the U.S. regards Asean “as an important institution that advances the liberal order,” said 



      Aaron L. Connelly, 



       research fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy. “It is about Southeast Asia as a region, yes, but it is also about Asean as an institution.”

  Tesla Earnings: What to Watch

    Focus will be on the electric auto maker’s Model X and its next car, the Model 3

fourth quarter results will be released after the bell Wednesday. Here’s what you need to know:

Tesla is expected to post an operating profit of 16 cents a share according to analysts polled by FactSet, compared with a loss of 13 cents a share reported in the fourth quarter of 2014. Higher volumes from the Model S sedan helped to mute the costs related to a slow launch of the Model X sport-utility vehicle. Tesla has posted only one profitable quarter on the basis of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Revenue is forecast to rise 64% to $1.79 billion for the fourth quarter as vehicle deliveries rose to 17,400, a 75% increase over the same period a year ago. Sales are closely watched given the amount of cash needed to run an auto company and the expectation that more scale will aid Tesla’s business.



Tesla was building about 250 Model Xs a week as of the end of December, far short of the approximately 800 it aims to ramp up to. Achieving full production will be important in meeting hot demand for the SUV and stanching cash outflows, but analysts have seen hiccups with the Model X as reason for concern.

Tesla’s stock had been among the auto industry’s hottest, even as falling gasoline prices crimped demand for the broader electric-vehicle market. A combination of factors—including plans by competitors to directly take on Tesla and heightened concerns about U.S. auto demand and the global economy—have hit Tesla shares in 2016. The stock has fallen 30% over the course of 2016, hitting $157.74 last week, representing a fresh 52-week nadir. In a note to investors Monday, Credit Suisse analyst Dan Galves said “repeated underestimation of Tesla’s ability to deliver” is overblown and the current price represents an opportunity.

Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       is on the hook to debut the company’s next car, the Model 3, by the end of March and details of that product are likely to be disclosed during the earnings conference call that takes place at 5:30 p.m. EST. This vehicle, slated to start at $35,000 with a 200-mile electric range, is necessary if Mr. Musk is going to reach his longer-term volume goals.

It has been nearly a year since Tesla announced the creation of a stationary storage business that could eventually help the company reach sustainable profitability. Production of the first battery packs were slated to begin at the company’s new factory in Nevada, and an update on output and customer backlog will be closely watched. Mr. Musk has projected solid demand.

The Chinese government is offering big incentives for electric vehicles that make that market the most important for EVs in the world. Since those rules favor local producers, Tesla may talk about whether expanding production in China with a joint-manufacturing partner is in the cards (much like larger auto makers have done).

Tesla’s giant battery factory near Reno, Nev., is closely watched and the company’s previously-disclosed timetable raises questions. Is the company ready to start producing cells? Is it on track to make batteries for the Model 3?

  Tesla’s Fourth-Quarter Loss Nearly Triples   

    Full-year 2015 loss widens to $889 million from $294 million in 2014

Luxury electric car maker


said its fourth-quarter net loss nearly tripled to $320.4 million as the costs of launching its Model X sport-utility vehicle led to an 11th consecutive quarterly loss.
However, Tesla held to a strong sales forecast in 2016 and the 2017 launch of its next product, giving investors something to cheer.
The stock jumped nearly 9% in after-hours trading after closing down $4.58 at $143.67 in 4 p.m. Nasdaq trading on Wednesday. It released results after 4 p.m.
Wall Street had expected a slim operating profit for the quarter excluding stock-based compensation and lease accounting. It reported an operating loss of $113.9 million, or 87 cents a share.
“I feel very good about things right now,” said Chief Executive Officer 



      Elon Musk



       in a call after the earnings. Mr. Musk said the company has moved past a difficult period and is set for smoother times. “The last several months have been quite excruciating, really.”
The stock gained as Tesla affirmed plans to sell its next-generation Model 3 electric car by the end of 2017, and said it would be producing nearly 1,000 a week of its $81,000 and up Model X SUV by the end of March.
Overall, Tesla said it could build up to 90,000 vehicles overall this year, which would be about 80% higher than its 2015 production.
The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company said it could achieve a net profit in the final quarter of 2016 and post an operating profit for the full year including adjustments. Wall Street forecasts an adjusted profit of $1.71 a share, or about $224 million, this year.
Tesla’s fourth quarter revenue rose 27% to $1.21 billion from $956.6 million a year earlier as deliveries of its new vehicles jumped 76% in the quarter. Its full year net loss was $889 million on revenue of $4.05 billion.
The auto maker projected that it would become net cash flow positive for the year after investing $1.5 billion in capital expenses, a figure slightly lower than the $1.6 billion it invested in 2015. Tesla’s supply of cash on hand fell to $1.2 billion at year end, down from $1.4 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Tesla had been burning cash a rate of more than $400 million a quarter for more than a year as its spending ramped up and deliveries of the Model X hadn’t begun. With the fourth quarter’s revenue gains, Tesla generated about $179 million in cash from operations in the quarter even as capital spending of $411 million dragged down its cash.
Chief Financial Officer 



      Jason Wheeler



       said his marching orders were to maintain or increase cash. The company’s increase in net cash for the year will include taking some money from a recently expanded asset-backed line of credit.
Tesla’s results suggested its used car business is starting to have an impact. Used vehicle revenues are included in its general “services” category, which jumped 47% to $97 million in the quarter.
Tesla said it intentionally slowed production of the Model X in January to improve quality. Tesla delivered just 206 Model X SUVs last quarter.
Tesla said its investments in the machinery required to build the lower cost Model 3 will begin this year. It stuck to its forecast of production beginning late next year. Tesla plans to show on March 31 a prototype of the vehicle, which are expected to start at $35,000 and drive at least 200 miles on a single charge.

  In the Future, Chevy’s Going to Need a Bigger Bolt

    Before long, the electric-car market will be a competitive battlefield and the latest from Chevrolet will be a solid player. But will the Bolt project be enough?

That’s a fact. No one knows what the face of American personal mobility will be in 10 years. No. One. Knows.
I recently spent a couple of days with the good people of
in Detroit, who are, I assure you, very interested in what comes next, and they’re devilishly clever besides. But, as I say, they don’t have any idea what will become of the U.S. market’s record light-vehicle sales in 10 years; or whether oil prices will be sky-high or rock bottom; or what the hell the public will want then.
Five years? Oh, dude, they have that locked and loaded. I was able to drive a late-prototype Chevy Bolt EV around the campus of GM’s Warren Technical Center, which is still a sight to see, still redolent with midcentury optimism. The Bolt is an all-electric, B-segment hatch with a claimed range of more than 200 miles, 200 horsepower, sub 7-second acceleration, and a starting price, after the $7,500 tax credit, of around $30,000 (state credits may also apply). In the march to the practical, affordable electric car for the masses, those are magic metrics. Due date: Q4, 2016.
My pocket review: It’s a toaster, for an age when toast will be weirdly hip.
Meanwhile, in the sheds of Hamtramck they are knocking together the lightweight, mixed-material Cadillac CT6, a full-size sedan, in a flurry of robotic arms and laser beams. Marvy. But as to foreknowledge of the full-size sedan market 10 years out, they might as well be waving surrender.
Why? Because GM, the auto industry and American society on wheels (other markets are on other timelines) are about to be swept through twin wormholes of emissions regulation and vehicle autonomy, and no one knows what’s on the other side. Of special note is the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirement of 54.5 mpg by 2025, a heroic figure that the Obama administration won from auto makers in the dark days of the bailout.

$37,500 (estimated, not including $7,500 federal tax credit)

Battery-electric vehicle with permanent-magnet electric motor and single gearset; 288-cell, 60-KWh lithium-ion battery; front-wheel drive.

164.0 inches/3,580 pounds

102.4 inches

<7 seconds

>200 miles (est)

90 miles/30 minutes (SAE Combo Fast Charge)
It was and is wise public policy, regardless of the current price of oil. Fuel economy/emissions standards are spiraling upward around the industrialized world as governments turn to face the challenge and politics of climate change. There was no way the U.S. auto sector could stay on those sidelines and remain globally competitive. That, we know.
CAFE has been the one lighthouse of certainty on the horizon. To hit that number, car makers are certain the machine has to change. Mass and general electrification will come to the U.S. light-vehicle market. Ten years, tops.
But, as I say, no one knows for sure.
The Bolt is built on the Uncertainty Principle. The significance of Chevrolet’s Bolt is that it marks the final readiness of EVs for the masses. No more measured praises, no more wait-and-see. Whichever way the market goes, the machine is sufficient to the task. You can’t object that the Bolt is too expensive, because it won’t be; you can’t say it doesn’t have enough range, because it certainly will. You can’t say EVs aren’t quick enough, because no one ever said they weren’t quick.
All this the Bolt accomplishes, or will, when it hits the showrooms late this year, a year ahead of of Tesla’s EV commuter-car, the Model 3.
The Bolt is no such moonshot. Compared with, for instance, BMW’s paradigm-shaking i Division—its Zaha Hadid-designed spaceport in Leipzig, specializing in carbon-composite construction—GM’s efforts toward electrification are measured and strategic, even to a fault.
For example, the Bolt will not be built on a separate assembly line with dramatic lighting, like the BMW i3, but at the sturdy, unpicturesque hall at Orion Township, Mich. The Bolt deploys smart but fairly standard lightweight steel and aluminum construction for its body and chassis; but the fact is the CT6’s body in white is a more exotic structure.
While the Bolt has some strong and fearless character lines, the silhouette and envelope fairly scream multipurpose vehicle normalcy. It has a grille, though it doesn’t particularly need one. The doors and cabin openings are huge, and the distance between passengers and the swept windshield airy. GM cites a front passenger volume of 52.2 cubic feet (that’s about the size of an ice box outside a convenience store, if that helps).
Of my 45-minute tootle around GM’s campus, there isn’t much to tell, except that, like all EVs with batteries in the floor, the Bolt’s packaging is advantageous. GM’s Executive Chief Engineer of Electric Vehicles Pam Fletcher noted the Bolt offered D-segment interior space, in a car with a B-sized (compact) footprint. Adjustable regen braking, brisk steering. Nice.

Still, as much as GM might like to say otherwise, the Bolt is not a conceptual breakthrough but rather a triumph of procurement, namely, the small, lightweight and powerful battery concealed under the floor. Comprising 288 lithium cobalt prismatic cells arranged like rows of business envelopes, the Bolt’s battery pack holds a mighty charge of 60 kwh (with 140 kW peak output, or 200 hp) while weighing 960 pounds, including all the thermal management plumbing. There will be an eight-year/100,000-mile warranty on the battery.
When Chevy’s Volt plug-in hybrid got off the ground in 2008, GM was paying $1,000 for a kwh of automotive-grade lithium-ion storage. Today, that number is $145 per kwh, and GM gets its cell-level batteries from LG Electronics in South Korea.
Wall Street analysts forecast a price drop to around $125/kwh after Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada comes fully online. But, as Bolt battery engineer Bill Wallace noted, “The Koreans already have a Gigafactory.”
And what about Tesla? The Model 3 compact family sedan will make its public debut next month, with production for Q4, 2017 (but Tesla is famous for being on island time). Tesla also promises 200-plus range, and a price of $35,000, before the federal tax credits, effectively undercutting the Bolt by $2,500.
And just like that, the Bolt turns a corner. GM and Tesla, their competitors and all their proxies are poised to fight a price war, a procurement war, over the price of batteries that will drive energy storage below the $100/kwh mark. Numbers like that make electric cars for the masses a real, levelheaded engineering proposition.
Maybe, could be, nobody’s quite sure. GM made its dreams scalable, just in case.

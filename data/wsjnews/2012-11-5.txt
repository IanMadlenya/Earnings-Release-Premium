  Tesla Posts Loss, but Production Ramps Up

Electric-car maker

posted a wider third-quarter loss on rising expenses.
The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company also said it had reached a production rate of 200 cars a week, a level it needs to generate positive operating cash flow. It was producing five cars a week at the beginning of the quarter.
Its shares rose about 8%, or $2.29, to $31.21 in afternoon Nasdaq stock market trading as investors cheered the news on its higher production rate.
In September, it warned of an as much as $200 million revenue shortfall this year as a result of production problems. It reaffirmed a full-year revenue forecast of between $400 million and $440 million, down from a prior forecast of between $560 million and $600 million.

as they report and compare their results with analysts' estimates. Sort by date and industry.
Tesla began deliveries of its all-electric Model S sedan in June, a month ahead of schedule. But the about $100,000 vehicle later ran into production delays, which Tesla suggested stemmed from problems with its supply chain. Tesla said on Monday that it produced almost 350 and delivered more than 250 Model S sedans during the latest quarter.
Tesla reported a loss of $110.8 million, or $1.05 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $65.1 million, or 63 cents a share. Excluding factors such as stock-based compensation, the per-share loss widened to 92 cents from 55 cents a year earlier.
Revenue fell 13% to $50.1 million from $57.7 million a year earlier on a decline in development services. Automotive sales, which make up most of the top line, rose 16%. Revenue from development services, or work it performed for other auto makers, dropped to $81,000, from $14.4 million.
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a per-share loss of 90 cents, with revenue of $48.3 million.
Gross margin was negative 17.7%, compared with a positive 29.9% margin a year earlier due to the cost of introducing the Model S and the limited output from its factory.
Operating expenses rose 22% to $99.7 million, reflecting higher research and development and overhead costs.
The company has said it hopes to reach a weekly production rate of 400 Model S vehicles by year-end.

  Tesla Earnings: What to Watch

    The auto maker is expected to post an adjusted net loss of 52 cents a share

second-quarter financial results are expected to be released after market close on Wednesday. Here’s what you need to know:

Tesla is expected to post an adjusted net loss of 52 cents a share compared with a loss of 48 cents a share in the same period a year earlier. Costs are increasing amid big investments in a new battery factory in Nevada and future products.

Second-quarter revenue is forecast to equal $1.6 billion, a 36% increase compared with a year ago. A 25% increase in deliveries of its vehicles is the main reason revenue is up, but it also books revenue from selling U.S. federal emissions credits and selling batteries for residential use. Sales, while up, didn't meet expectations, with 14,370 sales falling well short of the company’s initial 17,000 forecast.



Tesla raised $1.7 billion in an offering in May, but Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       has since said the company may require more money to finance additional products. Sales came in short of expectations in the second quarter and spending on the company’s battery factory increased, likely increasing the need to dig into the company’s cash reserves.


late in the second quarter to combine with

Both companies share Mr. Musk as a chairman and top shareholder. On Monday, the electric-vehicle maker announced it reached a firm deal with SolarCity
. Analysts are likely to probe the financial impact of the merger on both companies and how the two entities will benefit by coming together.

Tesla may update the number of reservations it has for its Model 3, a sedan due late next year to compete near the lower end of the EV market. At last count Tesla had 373,000 nonbinding reservations. But in the interim, Tesla also has
of its Model S and Model X to try to capture more sales ahead of its release, and it has endured scrutiny related to its deployment of semiautonomous technology.

The quality of the company’s first SUV is still in question nearly a year after Tesla delivered the first handful of units. Customers continue to complain about glitches and output of the model haven’t approached those of the Model S. If deliveries don’t pick up in the second half, Tesla has little chance to meet its 80,000 delivery goal.

Tesla been working on an update to its Autopilot after a Model S driver died using the company’s semiautonomous system. Eventually, the company will need to rework its system without a major ally:
NV said in July it is planning to end its relationship Tesla. Look for Tesla to talk about how it will go forward system without one of the leading suppliers on its team.

Mr. Musk introduced a new long-term plan in July that included commitments to make an electric semi-truck, a pickup, a small SUV and a small bus-like vehicle. Mr. Musk often uses earnings calls to elaborate on business plans, and there are many blanks left to fill in on this blueprint.

//Aug. 5, 2016 5:30 a.m. ET/For More U.S. Cities, Downtown Is a Center of Economic Strength

PHILADELPHIA—Theresa Lounsbery sets out from her apartment in this city’s blue-collar Lower Northeast section each workday. Her neighborhood, Oxford Circle, a district of 2 square miles, has been hammered by manufacturing’s long slide. Median household income in her immediate area is down more than 30% since 2000 to roughly $37,000.
But less than 40 minutes later, the 43-year-old sat on an elevated train approaching Philadelphia’s Center City, a 7.7-square-mile mini-boomtown framed by a skyline about to reach new heights with a 1,121-foot office tower under construction. The median income in parts of greater Center City has shot up nearly 90% to $80,000 in the past 15 years. High-earners scoop up townhouses for $800,000 or more, while businesses and law firms lease gleaming office space.
Ms. Lounsbery moved to Oxford Circle with her teenage sons two years ago because of cheap rent: $670 a month for a two-bedroom apartment on the upper floor of a row house. A preschool teacher for 10 years, Ms. Lounsbery studied to be a paralegal to earn more money after her divorce. Last summer, she started working at a personal-injury law firm, making double her teacher’s salary and gaining a foothold in the Center City economy.
Ms. Lounsbery’s 10-mile commute highlights the little-noticed polarization under way in many postindustrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest.
For years, economists and urban experts talked about the doughnut hole of decay in city centers. But increasingly, many urban cores are islands of economic strength surrounded by decay that reaches out into inner-ring suburbs—beyond which fortunes rise again in more distant suburbs.
Polarization has increased within other U.S. cities, where a turnaround for city centers has been accompanied by economic decline or stagnation in many longtime middle-class enclaves and lower-income neighborhoods with high minority populations, according to a census data analysis by The Wall Street Journal.
Many neighborhoods within city limits are sinking amid a continuing loss of lower-skilled jobs offering good wages, while downtowns benefit from an influx of often well-educated young adults drawn to urban living, and the arrival of businesses eager to hire them.
As in Philadelphia, gains in the heart of many U.S. cities have come at a time of wider neighborhood decline, the Journal analysis found. Since 2000, median income has fallen in a majority of census tracts in Buffalo, Baltimore, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Milwaukee and Chicago, all of which saw their downtown districts improve.
Developers are squeezing in more high-end housing around Baltimore’s revitalized waterfront. A new office tower is rising in Milwaukee that will be the city’s second-tallest. And Chicago boasts a parade of corporations relocating downtown.
As gentrification battles in hot global cities such as New York and San Francisco attract national focus, many more cities would like to spread recent economic gains in their urban core across the city, rather than temper them.
Job gains are concentrated in urban centers, largely to the benefit of downtown-area residents and suburban commuters, leaving many city dwellers with few good options, said Alan Mallach, a senior fellow at the Flint, Mich.-based think tank Center for Community Progress. Mr. Mallach has studied such polarization in former industrial cities including Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland and Pittsburgh.
Over the past three decades, neighborhoods in urban cores have been growing richer, whiter and better educated, according to a study by Nathaniel Baum-Snow, a University of Toronto associate business economics professor, and 




      Daniel Hartley, 




       a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago economist.
A study by City Observatory, a Portland, Ore., think tank focused on urban data analysis, found a tripling over the past four decades of urban census tracts where at least 30% of people live in poverty. Its authors, who analyzed a 10-mile radius around the city center in the 51 largest metros, found many more areas shifted into high poverty than experienced economic gains.
Overall, Philadelphia, the nation’s fifth-most-populous city, notched a 14.3% decline in median income from 2000 to 2014 on an inflation-adjusted basis, a drop that exceeded the 10.4% nationwide decrease. The census data analyzed by the Journal showed income gains in Philadelphia over the past 15 years have clustered around flourishing Center City.
For every area of the city that had income growth, more than two other parts posted drops—including swaths of traditionally middle-class Northeast Philadelphia, a 45-square-mile area that reaches to the city line and where more than a quarter of the city’s 1.57 million people live. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, elected last fall, has said residents’ ZIP Code shouldn’t determine their future.
Baltimore officials recently reached a local hiring and affordable housing agreement with backers of a proposed $5.5 billion development south of downtown led by Under Armour Chief Executive 




      Kevin Plank.




       Critics want the developer to do more.
In Milwaukee, where nearly a fifth of the tax base is in 3% of the city’s land area, officials are pushing to send economic ripples beyond downtown. “We can’t have two cities. We can’t have a downtown that is successful and neighborhoods that are not,” said 




      Rocky Marcoux, 




       development commissioner.
There is some fear that growing urban disparities, if left unchecked, could spur more unrest like what shook Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo., in recent years, where anger at police only partly fueled heated protests. “We haven’t had that spark that has created that action, but it could happen at any point in some neighborhoods,” said Beth McConnell, policy director for a group of community development corporations in Philadelphia.
In Lower Northeast Philadelphia, housing prices have dropped 10.2% in the past 10 years—a span that includes the foreclosure crisis—compared with a 6.5% increase citywide, according to Kevin Gillen, a Philadelphia-based senior research fellow at Drexel University’s Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation. A three-bedroom row house on Ms. Lounsbery’s block sold in June for $103,000.
Broadly, Philadelphia’s job mix has changed since 2000. Manufacturing accounts for less than 4% of jobs, down from 7%, and government positions make up 14% of the total, down from 16%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The largely low-wage hospitality sector accounts for 9.4%, up from 7.7%. Education and health have grown from about 25% of city jobs to about 31%. The professional and business services sector including law firms has edged up as well.
At the sprawling Cardone Industries plant, near Ms. Lounsbery’s Oxford Circle home, workers earn $15 to $20 hourly plus benefits remanufacturing used auto parts. This year, the closely held company said its brakes division will move to Mexico, claiming 1,350 of the facility’s roughly 2,200 jobs by May 2018. Spokesman Kevin Feeley said the company must compete with rivals and expects to add hundreds of higher-paying jobs locally in its electronics division over time.
Ms. Lounsbery, a Philadelphia native, has seen the decline firsthand.
“There aren’t a lot of industrial jobs in and around the city like there used to be,” she said. She thinks she may leave the neighborhood in a couple of years.
Oxford Circle and surrounding neighborhoods once teemed with middle-class workers laboring at factories as well as police officers and other municipal employees. The loss of public-sector jobs over the past decade has hit these areas hard, said Moody’s Analytics senior economist Adam Kamins.
“Those are the old white working-class neighborhoods. As jobs left, households left,” Mr. Gillen of Drexel said. “The revitalization of Philadelphia is really the story of the revitalization of Center City and adjoining neighborhoods….I’d like to see more neighborhoods in the city participating in the city’s renaissance. We have momentum, but it’s unbalanced.”
Since 2000, the population of greater Center City has risen 17% to 185,000. That area is 62% white, up from 53% in 2000, according to Center City’s improvement district. Median household income over that time jumped in most of greater Center City by at least 20%, census figures show.
Center City’s upward trajectory was aided by a pair of 10-year, property-tax breaks that drove a residential building boom starting in the late 1990s, and by the 1993 opening of a downtown convention center that added restaurants, hotels, shops and cultural amenities, said Paul Levy, chief executive of the business improvement district. The millennial surge that started roughly a decade ago has spilled beyond the traditional downtown boundaries.
Longtime residents of Northern Liberties, a former industrial area considered part of greater Center City, say it has grown visibly denser and richer over the past couple of decades, with Teslas and BMWs plying the narrow streets. Housing prices there have risen 61% over the past 10 years, said Drexel’s Mr. Gillen.
This year, Shailee Viroja and her husband, both doctors, paid $830,000 for a new 3,500-square-foot townhouse in Northern Liberties. Dr. Viroja, 30, said the urban vibe attracted them.
“It seems like it’s all young professionals and young families,” she said. “It’s quiet, but there’s a lot going on, restaurants and bars.”
But there is no guarantee the progress downtown will continue. One key question is whether the young adults who have flocked to cities will stay.
In Philadelphia, which for years has retained a sizable share of recent college graduates, those in their 20s and early 30s now make up 40% of downtown residents. But a 2014 study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that half of Philadelphia’s millennials didn’t expect to live in the city in five to 10 years, citing job and career reasons and concerns about schools, child-rearing and crime.
There is already some data suggesting millennial population growth is shifting away from cities to the suburbs and exurbs, said Mr. Kamins of Moody’s Analytics.
Because that population bulge of young adults is “time limited,” cities must lock them in by focusing on the quality of public schools and public spaces, Mr. Levy said.
Center City still has a mix of job opportunities, with about a third requiring only a high school diploma, said Mr. Levy, but the rising economic disparity within his city concerns him. “To have huge poverty right next to wealth, that’s just not healthy for democracy,” he said.
Harold Epps, 




       Philadelphia’s commerce director, said city leaders know they need to find a way to spread the prosperity. One broad goal is to get more residents the skills employers want, from software coding to plumbing. “We have to find jobs for our existing population,” he said.

  Tech Companies Still Trusted More on        Autonomous-Car Development   

    Surveys before and after news of fatal Tesla crash find greater confidence in Silicon Valley than in traditional auto makers

A fatality linked to Tesla Motor Inc.’s Autopilot system has done little to dent confidence in Silicon Valley’s ability to do a better job than traditional auto makers when it comes to development of software for autonomous cars, according to a new AlixPartners LLP survey.
The consulting firm surveyed slightly more than 1,500 respondents shortly before the late-June
and then followed up with a revised study after the incident attracted significant attention. In both cases, 41% of respondents said they trusted Silicon Valley most to develop self-driving software, far exceeding those who consider Japanese, U.S. or European auto makers the best fit.
The company’s initial survey was done without respondents’ knowledge of the fatality, which occurred in May.
The results underscore the concern among conventional auto makers that they are perceived to be behind Tesla,


Google and other tech firms in the race to deploy autonomous vehicles. Most major auto makers have devoted significant research and budgets to self-driving car development, but Google’s car project team and Tesla Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       have gotten credit for being faster movers in certain areas.
Google, for instance, has been credited for amassing more than a million test miles with autonomous prototypes on public roads, creating a sizable lead over competitors. While Tesla has been criticized for not doing enough to educate drivers on how to properly use its Autopilot, the company has been the most aggressive when it comes to equipping its cars with advanced safety systems.
Overall interest in autonomous cars didn’t take much of a hit after the Tesla fatality was disclosed, slipping only 3 percentage points. There was “not a massive falloff” in popular opinion around self-driving cars after the crash was disclosed, AlixPartners Managing Director Mark Wakefield said.
Joshua Brown, a 40-year-old Ohio owner of a Tesla Model S, died when his electric car drove under the trailer of an 18-wheel truck on a highway in Williston, Fla., on May 7, according to regulators and a Florida Highway Patrol report. The cause of the crash is still being investigated.
The second survey showed the crash may have raised Tesla’s name recognition in the self-driving sphere and raised awareness of autonomous cars generally. Before the crash, Google was the dominant company people knew of when it came to self-driving cars, at 42%, while Tesla came in second at 23%. In the second survey, 55% of participants cited Tesla, while Google’s name fell to 20%.
Trust in autonomous cars rose when people were given the option to take control of the car in an instant versus having a fully autonomous vehicle, Mr. Wakefield said.
AlixPartners first conducted the study in June partially because the skeptical media attention around self-driving cars didn’t necessarily reflect what the firm saw happening in the industry, Mr. Wakefield said.
A similar survey recently released by the Boston Consulting Group of consumers in the U.S., China and Germany supported AlixPartner’s results. People in those markets didn’t lose marked interest in riding in self-driving vehicles, be they completely or semiautonomous, even in light of recent scrutiny around the technology’s safety.
Autonomous cars found the most favor in China, where Boston Consulting saw an uptick in interest, from 75% in a study conducted last August to 81% this month. In the U.S., a slight drop from 53% to 48% of participants showed interest in self-driving cars. German consumers remained most wary when compared to the other two markets.

  SolarCity Losses Widen on Higher Expenses

    Largest home-solar company in U.S. has been in spotlight since Tesla Motors offered to buy it in June

, which is in the
by fellow 



      Elon Musk



       company


reported a wider quarterly loss Tuesday as operating expenses climbed sharply.
For the current quarter, the home solar company forecast an adjusted loss between $2.55 a share and $2.65 a share, worse than estimated by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, who forecast a loss of $2.26.
For the latest quarter, SolarCity reported a loss of $250.3 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with $155.7 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. The quarter’s adjusted loss was $2.32 a share, better than analysts’ predictions of $2.44 a share.
Revenue rose 81% to $185.8 million, far above analysts’ expectations of $146 million.
The company reported that revenue from periodic billings more than doubled from a year earlier, hitting $141.1 million. Total operating expenses, which includes some $29 million linked to restructuring expenses, rose to $265.4 million from $175.8 million during the same period a year earlier.
Shares of the company, tied to the Tesla offer price, barely budged after hours, rising 0.2% to $24.60. Shares of the company have been down some 53% over the past 12 months.
SolarCity, the largest home solar company in the U.S. by rooftop installations, has been in the spotlight since Tesla Motors
.
Tesla’s offer for the San Mateo, Calif.-based solar-panel installer raised eyebrows because Mr. Musk, who is chief executive of Palo Alto, Calif.-based Tesla, is chairman of both companies’ boards of directors and a cousin of SolarCity CEO 



      Lyndon Rive



       and 



      Peter Rive, 



       the company’s chief technology officer.
Mr. Musk and Mr. Rive want to combine the firms into a single integrated sustainable energy company that harnesses sun power from home roof arrays and channels it into energizing electric cars in the garage, and additional batteries that can store the power for later use.
Opponents of the deal say that Mr. Musk, who owns more than 20% of each company, has an outsize influence that could create a conflict of interest. Some analysts have called Tesla’s purchase a bailout for SolarCity; the panel-maker’s share price has fallen by more than half so far this year.
Tesla’s deal to buy SolarCity using stock was valued at $2.6 billion when it was announced, considerably lower than its original proposal. The lower purchase price prompted questions from investors about whether the outlook for SolarCity’s business—or the residential solar market in general—is cooling off.
Mr. Musk told investors on a conference call Tuesday afternoon that the lower price for SolarCity is what independent board members of both companies came up with “in an exhaustive discussion that lasted a week or two.”
“I haven’t inquired about the details and I’m not privy to the details, but it’s what they concluded is fair, between independent board members of SolarCity and board members of Tesla,” he said.
If shareholders approve the deal, the companies could combine by the end of this year.
Using batteries to store electricity at homes and businesses is key to developing more solar power. The market for so-called stationary energy storage is currently tiny, but some analysts and clean-energy companies are forecasting that demand for batteries to store electricity will grow, proving integral to putting more wind and solar power on the grid and a cheaper alternative to conventional utility equipment.
SolarCity is likely to pair batteries with most solar panels it installs by 2020, as demand for storage increases as a way to balance out the flow of electricity between buildings with panels and local power grids, the company said.
“Solar and batteries go together like peanut butter and jelly,” Mr. Musk said. “If you don’t have the batteries there to balance the grid and buffer the power, you really cannot go beyond a certain level of solar in a particular neighborhood.”

  Auto Makers, Regulators Spar on Fuel Economy   

    Environmental Protection Agency recently predicted car companies will sell vehicles averaging 50.8 miles a gallon by 2025

TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.—Auto makers and environmental regulators are publicly sparring over stringent
, signaling a pitched battle ahead over whether to relax the Obama administration’s future mileage targets.
At an automotive conference on Michigan’s northern shore this week, industry lobbyists seized on a July Environmental Protection Agency
that predicted car companies will sell vehicles averaging roughly 50.8 miles a gallon by 2025, below the 54.5 mpg goal unveiled when standards were set in 2012 and gasoline prices soared to record highs.
Regulators, meanwhile, said auto makers
with tougher mileage goals, showing few signs they will be softened. The EPA, with other agencies, must decide by April 2018 whether the standards should be relaxed, strengthened or left unchanged. Officials are awaiting car makers’ comments before making proposals.

The debate over rising government mileage targets dominated much of the discussions among car executives, regulators and researchers here despite fervent interest in automated vehicles after a May
of a

electric car driving itself.Auto makers are locking in vehicle investments now for mileage rules already on the books, whereas future rules and test results for autonomous cars remain hazy.
“We’re going to need some flexibility to make this work in the long term,” said 



      Mitch Bainwol, 



       head of a Washington lobbying group representing a dozen car makers, of meeting future fuel-economy goals.
Regulators could give more time to reach mileage targets and enhance credits for technologies that help companies meet standards, he said. “We’re all going to get there at some point in time. The question is: when and how?”
The July fuel-economy report, co-written by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and California environmental regulators, found dramatically lower prices at the gas pump are spurring purchases of fuel-thirsty pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles.
Since then, oil again dipped below $40 into
.
That makes mileage targets harder to meet, auto makers contend, since car sales determine their compliance. Stringent standards can force auto makers toward electric cars and other vehicles that consumers don’t want amid low fuel prices, Mr. Bainwol said.
But “that is wrong,” said 



      Chris Grundler, 



       head of the EPA’s transportation and air quality office, adding he wanted to “bust this myth.”
Car makers are beating current standards and selling millions of vehicles that already meet 2020 targets, he said.
Fuel-economy targets adjust based on market trends and vehicle sizes. “These standards were deliberately designed to preserve consumer choice. This is not a compliance problem,” Mr. Grundler said.
The standards, aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions and oil dependence, are a significant part of President 



      Barack Obama’s



       climate-change agenda. But the decision on where the mileage targets go falls to the winner of November’s presidential election, leaving car companies, regulators and environmental groups jockeying for position.
The July technical report kicked off a mandated review of mileage standards long before the toughest rules take effect. The promised midterm assessment helped executives from nearly every auto maker endorse the standards and sit behind Mr. Obama when he unveiled the mileage targets in July 2011.
The average mileage of vehicles sold in the U.S. in June was 25.3 mpg in real-world driving, down slightly from May, according to data compiled by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.
Environmental regulators emphasize that car makers have beaten the standards in recent years and that cheaper technologies enable them to meet the more ambitious 54.5 mpg goal, which translates to about 40 mpg in real-world driving. Car makers can do so with more-efficient gas engines, rather than significantly more hybrid and electric vehicles, according to regulators.
Still, car makers are locking in plans for electric vehicles and other cars well ahead of time, anticipating both increased demand and a need to sell them for compliance purposes. In addition to federal rules, California and other states require them to eventually sell millions of zero-emission vehicles, such as electric cars.


, dogged by an emissions-cheating scandal, aims to develop around 30 electric-car models representing up to 25% of sales over the next decade as part of a broader restructuring dubbed “Strategy 2025.”
The German auto giant in June committed $2 billion over the next decade to promote zero-emission vehicles as part of a record settlement with consumers and regulators to address 475,000 diesel-powered vehicles able to dupe government emissions tests.
Diarmuid O’Connell, 



       vice president of business development at Tesla, said other car makers aren’t offering alluring electric vehicles, likening many of them to boring appliances that are priced too high compared with gas-engine counterparts.
“The products are simply not compelling,” Mr. O’Connell said. Tesla, an unprofitable Silicon Valley company, reaps significant revenue selling credits to other car makers that fail to meet mileage standards.
Environmental groups earlier in the week said regulators’ July report showed auto makers can make cleaner cars. The Safe Climate Campaign on Monday said car companies had “declared war on the rules” by aggressively selling pickups and SUVs that forced regulators to lower expectations for what auto makers would achieve. In an op-ed in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the group called for strengthening mileage standards, contending car makers have technology on the shelf to meet higher targets.

  Tesla Loses $293 Million as Deliveries Fall Short, Expenses Rise

loss widened in the second quarter amid higher costs, but the company stuck to an ambitious plan that calls for building nearly 80,000 cars in 2016 and pulling forward a cheaper sedan aimed at the mass market.
The Silicon Valley electric car maker’s report follows a tumultuous period capped by a traffic fatality related to the company’s semiautonomous Autopilot system. Regulators also dinged the company’s practice of having certain buyers sign nondisclosure agreements and the company faced continued questions about the quality of its Model X sport-utility vehicle.
Tesla, long known as a company that moves faster than traditional auto makers, plowed forward during the quarter. It announced its intention to combine with

, which shares with Tesla 



      Elon Musk



       as chairman. On Monday, the Tesla announced a
valued at $2.6 billion.
Last month, 



      Mr. Musk



       laid out a revised master plan, calling for new electric buses, semi trucks and pickups to be sold under the Tesla name, and laying out a vision to be a more comprehensive supplier of energy products, including stationary batteries and solar panels.
The quarter’s financials, released Wednesday, show a similar portrait as past reports. The company is pulling in more revenue, but a variety of spending programs are outpacing gains on the top-line.
Unlike Detroit rivals, Tesla doesn’t sell conventional gasoline-powered SUVs or pickups.

and

are banking billions in quarterly profits, boosting their ability to pay the steeply rising costs to develop more sophisticated vehicles for markets around the world.
Tesla is growing far faster than Ford or GM, selling 25% more cars in the second quarter compared with a year ago. While volumes were short of initial expectations, Tesla said in a shareholder letter that it reached a steady output of 2,000 vehicles a week during the past quarter, and committed to boost that rate by nearly 20% by the end of the year.
Mr. Musk admitted the company had struggled to build cars in the first half of the year.
“We were in production hell for the first six months of this year,” he said on a conference call Wednesday. Mr. Musk added that he was personally going to meet with a supplier that was having problems.
He also teased that the company is planning soon to reveal a fully autonomous vehicle. “Full autonomy is going to come a hell of a lot faster than anyone thinks it will,” he said. “What we have under development is going to blow peoples’ minds. It blows my mind.”
Tesla shares rose slightly to $225.50 after the earnings came out following the market’s close. Investors have been closely watching Mr. Musk’s ability to improve production activities and meet the continued strong demand it sees for its electric cars, even as gasoline prices dent enthusiasm for the wider electric-vehicle market.
Tesla’s immediate financial portrait remains murky. While the company’s cash reserves rose to $3.25 billion, it is burning cash amid big investments in a Nevada battery plant under construction and a Model 3 entry sedan that is under development. It raised $1.7 billion during the quarter from an equity offering and reaped the benefits of hundreds of thousands of $1,000 refundable Model 3 deposits, allowing it to offset its outflows.
The auto maker is now pulling forward its full-scale production plan for the Model 3 by two years and it will begin certain production activities later this year. It is slated to go on sale in 2017.
A second-quarter loss of $293 million was 60% deeper compared with a year ago. Its operating loss equaled $1.06 a share, greater than the 52-cent loss analysts had been expecting.
Revenue rose 33% to $1.27 billion, with the company delivering 14,402 vehicles during the period, well short of the 17,000 it initially anticipated.
The auto maker ended its “residual value guarantee” in the U.S., a system that allowed customers to do a kind of “lease” from the company where it would agree to buy back cars after three years at a set price. The company said it no longer needed it to provide good leasing prices in the U.S. It has long caused an odd accounting system for Tesla because it can’t claim all the revenue from some sales up front.

  A Double Dose of Risk for Tesla in SolarCity Deal   

    Elon Musk’s two cash-burning companies have agreed to merge

Far more incredible than

       various plans to power our homes, cars and, perhaps one day, spaceships and hyperloops, are his powers of persuasion.
The announcement back in June that electric-car maker

The two companies said Monday that they had
though at a lower price than originally proposed.
A casual observer might conclude that, while the industrial logic is far from obvious, any damage should be limited. After all, Tesla’s market value is some 13 times that of SolarCity. And the companies say that they anticipate savings of $150 million in the first year—a substantial 5% return on the deal’s value even before Mr. Musk’s assertion that it is a step toward “solving the sustainable energy problem.”
The immediate problem, though, is far more prosaic: cash flow.
Without enough money coming in the door, no business can survive. And, on that front at least, Tesla latching on to SolarCity is the equivalent of a shipwrecked man clinging to a piece of driftwood grabbing on to another man without one. Tesla burned through 50 cents of cash for each dollar of revenue in the past four quarters, while SolarCity consumed a whopping $6.00.
In terms of actual cost-benefit for Tesla, bolting on SolarCity presents a double dose of danger. While it is being bought for stock, pending shareholder approval of the deal, it adds another cash drain when Tesla is spending heavily on starting production of its mass-market Model 3 sedan and finishing its
A more immediate danger is that skepticism about the deal casts more doubt on Tesla itself, dragging on its valuation. It can ill afford that as it makes raising fresh capital more dilutive.
Tesla’s ability to raise cash has depended on credulous investors who have bought equity and convertible-debt issues at multiples of expected 2018 profit that are many times higher than the likes of

By the time Tesla proposed buying SolarCity, meanwhile, the bloom already had come off such solar-rooftop-panel companies. SolarCity’s shares had dropped by 75% from their 2014 peak. Even since the deal’s announcement, SolarCity’s closest peers,
and

have fallen 16% and 10%, respectively.
Though Tesla raised $1.5 billion of equity in May, Mr. Musk said last week that it would need a “modest” amount again to finance the Model 3. The company hopes to sell 500,000 units a year by 2018—an immodest target given delays faced by its last new model and disappointing deliveries so far this year.
Mr. Musk’s ability to power Tesla’s market value may have to leap into ludicrous mode soon.

Tesla reported $1.6 billion in adjusted revenue and an adjusted loss of $1.06 a share Wednesday, which fell short of analysts’ estimates. On the bright side, Tesla reported operating cash flow of $150 million and said it spent $295 million on capital needs. The result was a free cash outflow of $145 million, good for the
in more than two years.
The best way to read the report is to look at what was included and what wasn’t. Refundable customer deposits for the Model 3 were included in operating cash flow. That could mean a big reversal later. But Tesla left out any updates about the $1,000 deposits. That is more than two months of silence since the company said it had received orders for 373,000 cars.
Meanwhile, capital expenditures are due to increase significantly in coming quarters. The company said in May it expects to spend about $2.25 billion in 2016 to help get the Model 3 ready for mass production. Tesla has spent just over $500 million on capital needs so far this year.
Tesla raised $1.7 billion in May from an equity sale, and now has $3.2 billion on its balance sheet, which offers some cushion. But those spending needs are hardly optional to meet the company’s huge automotive ambitions. And the company’s

  Warburg Pincus Leads $220 Million Round for Solar Lender Mosaic   

    Startup offers loans to homeowners to cover costs of solar systems, energy efficiency upgrades

Private-equity firm Warburg Pincus is leading a $220 million equity investment in energy-financing startup Solar Mosaic Inc., according to two people familiar with the situation.
The company, known as Mosaic, provides loans for solar installations for homeowners. It is starting to finance other energy-efficiency upgrades that are meant to reduce utility bills.
Mosaic is operating in the same sphere as

, which Tesla Motors Inc. is
.
Warburg Pincus will have a slight majority control of Mosaic through its $200 million investment, one person said. Other investors in the round include financial technology venture firm Core Innovation Capital and Obvious Ventures, a firm, co-founded by 



      Ev Williams, 



       that seeks to invest in startups that offer a positive social impact. 



      Andrew Beebe, 



       managing director at Obvious Ventures, has had a long career in solar energy.
In the energy sector, Warburg Pincus has invested primarily in oil and gas companies. But it did back a solar-panel manufacturer, Suniva Corp., in 2009.
Oakland, Calif.-based Mosaic had started out by crowdfunding commercial solar projects. But it later pivoted to raising institutional funding for portfolios of residential solar lending.
Mosaic has said that it plans to originate about $1 billion in residential-solar loans in the coming 12 months. It secured $200 million in credit from DZ Bank as the lead lender earlier this year. NY Green Bank also participated.
The company’s business model is built around allowing people to own their own solar systems. That contrasts against the predominant model of financing residential solar under lease programs in which homeowners rent the solar power their properties generate.
More homeowners are choosing to take out loans to pay for solar panels, rather than leasing them. Among the advantages of loans is that the borrower owns the solar panel at the end of the loan. Loans to own rather than lease likely will dominate the residential solar market in three to four years, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Mosaic partners with solar-installation contractors who offer its loans as an option to homeowners interested in getting solar or other energy upgrades. It says it has developed a quick credit-assessment formula, taking a page from the playbook of online-lending startups.
Other publicly traded financing companies for solar include

and


Privately held GreenSky LLC and Spruce Finance Inc., backed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, also operate in the category.
The company’s average loan is about $30,000, a much larger loan size than for consumer lenders such as Prosper Marketplace Inc. or


Earlier Mosaic investors include Spring Ventures, Serious Change, Blue Haven Initiative and Bronze Investments.

  Delphi Automotive: What to Watch 

    Auto parts maker on Wednesday expected to show  second-quarter profit of $1.55 per share versus $1.34 a year earlier

PLC will deliver its second-quarter earnings report before the bell on Wednesday. The auto parts maker is expected to show earnings of $1.55 per share compared with $1.34 a year earlier, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Expected revenue of $4.2 billion in the period represents an 8% increase compared with $3.9 billion on year ago, according to Thomson Reuters. Here’s what to watch:

Despite signs that U.S. light-vehicle demand has peaked, auto suppliers have been reporting strong earnings this year, as new vehicles come packed with more technology, an area of strength for Delphi.


recently beat analysts’ estimates on the strength of strong margins, while

NV also reported strong earnings, margin and revenue growth, while raising its full-year guidance despite bringing its relationship with Tesla Motors Inc. to an end this year. Investors will watch Delphi’s margins closely. The Center for Automotive recently released a study showing parts suppliers invested $44.4 billion from 2006 through 2015, either building or expanding factories in the U.S., according to Automotive News.

Delphi has been active in the merger market of late, snapping up smaller tech firms such as 3-D graphics company PureDepth Inc. Last year Delphi sold its heat- and cooling-systems division and its reception systems unit, as well as its stake in thermal joint ventures. It also invested in two companies and acquired three others, including two software firms, as it continues to retool its business for a world where cars are largely software and technology-driven. With private funding drying up and the prospect of interest rates rising in the near future, timing remains ripe for more tech-focused acquisitions.

Delphi’s shares are down roughly 20% on the year, despite bouncing back recently from levels that approached its two-year lows. Broader market turmoil combined with uncertainty abroad has kept Delphi’s shares depressed this year, boosting the case for further share buybacks,
. Delphi already plans to repurchase $1.5 billion in shares.

When demand faltered in China last year, Delphi laid off thousands of workers, only to hire them back when the market rebounded. The resulting $25 million in costs hit Delphi in both the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 2016. Delphi expects half its new business to come from Asia, especially China, so investors will be tuned into how renewed Chinese demand has impacted the supplier’s earnings there.

Delphi is considered a leader in autonomous vehicles, and its recently-announced partnership with the Singapore government to deploy a fleet of self-driving taxis is the latest sign it sees a bigger role in the industry’s move to self-driving cars. The goal is to help consumers commute to and from mass transit systems, but the program should also help Delphi show off both its hardware and software prowess in the

  Tesla and SolarCity Agree to $2.6 Billion Deal

    Electric car maker had made an offer in June to buy solar-energy company also chaired by Elon Musk

on Monday said it had reached a deal to buy

for less than the price it originally proposed, as 



      Elon Musk



       takes the next step forward with his plan to combine his electric-car and solar-energy companies.
The all-stock deal values SolarCity at about $2.6 billion, with SolarCity stockholders receiving 0.11 share of Tesla for each share of SolarCity, valuing them at $25.83 apiece, according to Friday’s closing prices.
That is below the original range of $26.50 to $28.50 per SolarCity share that Tesla had proposed in June.
Mr. Musk said Monday he wasn’t involved in the decision making about the valuation of the purchase.
If it is approved by shareholders, the deal would double Tesla’s workforce to nearly 30,000 employees and create a unique combination of solar, power storage and transportation, which Tesla says would be the world’s only integrated sustainable energy company.
The new company also would tie together two money-losing entities, dependent on borrowing from the market, adding potential risk along with opportunity.
Mr. Musk, who owns more than 20% of both companies and is the largest shareholder in both, plans to vote his shares in proportion to the voting by the companies’ publicly held shares.
He said earlier in July that he expects two-thirds of shareholders to approve the deal, which the companies expect will close in the fourth quarter.
“It’s really all part of solving the sustainable energy problem,” Mr. Musk said during a conference call with analysts to discuss the deal. “That’s why we are all doing this, to accelerate the advent of a sustainable energy world.”
Some analysts were skeptical of the deal’s value for Tesla, saying that buying an unprofitable solar company may not be the best financial move for Tesla, which up to now has primarily been an auto maker.
“It’s a bailout,” said 



      Jesse Pichel, 



       an investment banker at Roth Capital Partners, adding, “SolarCity has had a hard time raising money. Tesla solves that problem.”
Some in the solar industry, meanwhile, view the deal as a bargain for Mr. Musk, noting that SolarCity’s stock is down more than 50% from the start of the year.
“It’s how big fortunes are made,” said 



      Lynn Jurich, 



       chief executive of rival

“People who are willing to bet big and have a vision will be rewarded.”

The company aims to offer Tesla batteries with rooftop solar panels as a standard package for many of its customers in the next three to five years, Mr. Rive said.
Mr. Musk in June
that he backs as a means to vertically integrate his battery-storage business at Tesla with the solar-panel company.
A joint company would recognize $150 million or more in cost savings in the first full year after closing the transaction, he said.
The biggest area of cost savings may come from lowering SolarCity’s cost to obtain customers by leveraging Tesla’s strong brand recognition and retail store locations.
The solar company’s cost to acquire new customers rose 80% in the first quarter from the previous quarter, and is more than 30% of the overall cost of installing a home solar panel system.
“I think $150 million is conservative,” Mr. Musk said. “I think we will significantly exceed that in the first year.”
For Tesla, SolarCity brings teams of installers across more than a dozen states, which will be able to install electric-car chargers, separately or together with panels and batteries, the companies said.
Under the proposed terms, SolarCity now has a 45-day period to seek better offers, and Tesla had one more opportunity to sweeten its offer if SolarCity obtains a higher bid.
If SolarCity does accept a better deal during the 45 days, the company would pay Tesla a $26.1 million breakup fee.
A special committee of SolarCity board members analyzed the offer, compared it to various alternatives and decided the deal “is the best outcome for SolarCity shareholders, compared with other outcomes,” a person who helped advise the committee said Monday.

  Aviation Experts Urge Caution on Releasing Self-Driving Cars

    Dangers cited in rushing new technologies to market without proper training

Aviation-safety experts have advice for the car industry as it moves to autonomous-driving vehicles: Proceed slowly and make sure drivers realize the limits of the technology.
As airline pilots became increasingly reliant on automation over the years, the focus shifted to simplified cockpit displays and enhanced crew training.
Many high-end cars now offer sophisticated cruise-control and collision-avoidance systems that can maneuver in traffic and on highways without driver commands. From automatic braking to steering assist, manufacturers rely on them as marketing tools.
But several accidents involving


cars with such technology, including a fatal accident in Florida, have federal highway-safety regulators investigating the company’s onboard automation. Some aviation safety experts warn that existing automotive controls shouldn’t be considered mature autopilot systems.
“It’s quite ridiculous we would give somebody such a complex vehicle without training,” said former commercial pilot 



      Shawn Pruchnicki, 



       who teaches air safety at Ohio State University. It is a mistake, he added, “to assume that the general public is going to be able to jump in and understand what [the] limitations are.”
Early autopilots originated in airplanes around World War I, but it wasn’t until 1947 that a U.S. Air Force plane made the first trans-Atlantic flight using hands-off flying controls. Such features evolved and only became widespread gradually, allowing individual elements to be rigorously tested and verified before plane makers integrated them into complex flight-management systems.
Today, jumbo jets and supersonic fighters rely on a web of computerized equipment and software to get airborne, cruise and even land with little or no human input.
A key lesson from aviation is that reducing risks takes time.
“We have to create perfection in the collision-avoidance systems before we have the car drive itself,” said 



      Mark Rosenker, 



       a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board who dealt with safety issues affecting roads, rails and aircraft. So far, “there are nuances to these technologies that we have not yet perfected,” he noted, such as the difference between avoiding a car in front and detecting when a driver is veering off the road.
Tesla Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       has rejected calls to disable his company’s autopilot function, which steers cars more actively than those installed in other brands. But he has embraced one of the lessons from aviation: the importance of training users how to interact with complicated automation. Tesla has vowed to step up efforts to educate customers about the way its autopilots work.
The push toward self-driving vehicles has a long way to go to match advances in commercial planes. In theory, many jetliners can fly autonomously, except for taxiing to the gate and shutting off the engines.
Some computerized safeguards are designed to kick in automatically during particularly dangerous types of emergencies, including engine failure during takeoff.
Airplane automation can also be calibrated to different levels, based on crews’ preference. That is supposed to keeps pilots more aware and engaged. Airlines also require at least two pilots in cockpits, and the one not manipulating the controls is trained to monitor the automated systems.
But psychologists and automation experts say people tend to be poor monitors, whether they are behind the steering wheel or flying in an aluminum tube miles above the Earth. So airliners have extensive visual and aural warnings in case something goes wrong.
For cars, it is essential to develop auto-drive systems sophisticated enough to recognize when a vehicle is swerving between lanes or performing other dangerous maneuvers, according to 



      Martin Chalk, 



       an Airbus A380 pilot and president of the International Federation of Air Line Pilots’ Associations.
More important, according to Mr. Chalk, full-blown automation must be able to intercede to enforce highway rules and keep track of speed limits.
Automotive systems, however, need to avoid inundating operators with nonessential data, according to 



      Yannick Malinge, 



       product safety chief for
: “A key point is to give information to the driver that he or she needs to have, not what simply would be nice to have.”
Mr. Malinge emphasized that Airbus has devised its flight-management computers so that during each phase of flight, they prominently display just the most relevant information. The system knows “what information you will need under various circumstances, and what isn’t essential” to show pilots.
To be sure, aviation has suffered from pilots relying unduly on cockpit automation. High-profile accidents include an
Airbus A330 that crashed into the Atlantic in 2009 after pilots were confused by automated warnings. A perfectly functioning


777 that slammed down short of a San Francisco runway in clear weather four years later because the crew failed to monitor airspeed.
Drivers, of course, can’t depend on simulators or a co-pilot for help. But Tesla advises drivers to stay alert and keep their hands on the wheel in case they need to take over unexpectedly.

  Elon Musk Has Big Hopes for Storage Batteries, but the Market Is Small

    Tesla and SolarCity have foothold in the business, which has been slow to catch on

By combining

and


Elon Musk



       hopes to create an
company that can sell solar panels as well as the batteries to preserve their power to homes and businesses all over the world.
But to achieve his vision, Mr. Musk may once again have to virtually create a market from scratch, because so far, the demand for such batteries—especially among home consumers—remains extremely small.
Only about 450 U.S. homeowners installed batteries to save homemade electricity last year, according to GTM research, which tracks renewable energy markets. About 250 U.S. commercial property owners installed batteries, and suppliers installed larger battery packs for about two-dozen utility projects, GTM estimates.
“It’s still a relatively tiny market, compared to solar or wind today, and minuscule if you look at the complete electricity infrastructure,” said Ravi Manghani, an analyst at GTM.
The global power-storage market is forecast to grow from 1,000 megawatts installed in 2015, to more than 7,000 megawatts by 2025, according to research firm IHS. New government programs, such as a push by the Obama administration and federal lawmakers to extend renewable energy subsidies, are projected to help fuel the increase.
While total installations are expected to rise this year, the market for energy-storage batteries has been slow to materialize—and Tesla’s battery production has gotten off to a slower start than Mr. Musk anticipated.
Tesla has started selling heavy-duty batteries, called Powerpacks, to companies that supply utilities with energy, and smaller battery packs, called Powerwalls, to SolarCity and a few other companies that install them alongside rooftop solar panels. These batteries use the same ingredients as those that Tesla uses in its cars.
Residential battery systems cost between $1,300 and $2,000 a kilowatt-hour of storage, or $8,320 and $12,800 for a battery system the size of Tesla’s 6.4 kilowatt-hour Powerwall, according to GTM. Costs tend to vary widely as battery systems are customized.
The wholesale price for Tesla’s home battery is $3,000—excluding the operating software, labor and other installation costs as well as the inverter, which converts direct current into alternating current.
Homeowners who connect batteries to their solar panels can claim a federal tax credit equal to 30% of the total cost of both systems.
While Mr. Musk predicted last year that Tesla would sell as much as $50 million worth of storage batteries in 2015, up to $500 million this year, and between $2 billion and $5 billion of storage batteries in 2017, its sales appear to be considerably below those figures to date.
Tesla’s battery-storage business has been constrained and “is going to be heavily concentrated in [the fourth quarter] and probably heavily in November and December,”
.
Tesla said in May that it shipped 2,500 Powerwall batteries and 100 large Powerpack batteries, primarily to customers in Europe and Australia. The company hasn’t disclosed its revenues from battery sales, but some analysts estimate the company is selling far less than it had forecast.
Tesla decided to wait until a portion of
, was completed, at the end of last year, before shipping Powerwalls and Powerpacks, a company spokesman said. The entire factory is now close to fully opening.
Though the market for energy-storage batteries is small, it already has a lot of potential competitors due to the number of companies that make lithium batteries for other uses. They include large manufacturers such as

,

and


Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS, expects Tesla to sell about $230 million of batteries this year and $1 billion in 2017, below the company’s forecast.
Tesla and SolarCity, which already collaborate on power storage and have joint marketing, have an early foothold in the nascent market, however.
SolarCity is working to complete a 13-megawatt solar farm and storage unit packed with Tesla batteries on the Hawaiian island of Kauai that will provide 52 megawatt-hours of electricity per day, enough to supply up to one-quarter of the island’s midday power needs. SolarCity has two other utility projects under contract and commercial customers including


Tesla is supplying batteries to several projects with other companies. Among those are 50 megawatts of energy storage projects, spread across several dozen Los Angeles area office buildings, that San Francisco startup Advanced Microgrid Solutions is developing for

Southern California utility.
Tesla’s batteries pack a lot of energy into a small space, which makes them easier to install next to office buildings in urban neighborhoods, said 



      Susan Kennedy, 



       Advanced Microgrid Solutions’ chief executive. “As utilities figure out how to use storage in their distribution systems, the market is going to grow dramatically,” she added.
While Tesla is an early mover, “it is by no means the only or the biggest mover,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. Still, Mr. Musk’s fame, and the popularity of Tesla’s Model S electric car, may help the brand expand into batteries, some rivals and vendors say.
“People ask everyday about getting a Powerwall,” said Mark Coleman, who sells rooftop solar panels and battery systems through his online store, Wholesale Solar Inc., in Redding, Calif. Powerwall batteries aren’t designed to be used as off-grid power sources, as one Powerwall can only run a normal refrigerator for about a day, he said.
He usually suggests other brands, such as lead-acid batteries made by Crown Battery, of Fremont, Ohio, “that last as long, and you don’t have to spend as much.”

  Google’s Self-Driving Car Leader Exits 

    Chief Technology Officer Chris Urmson gives no clear reason for his departure

The face of the Google self-driving car effort has left the project at a crucial juncture as the company tries to transition its driverless-car technology into a commercial product.
Chris Urmson, the project’s chief technology officer and former director, said in a blog post Friday that he was leaving Google parent Alphabet Inc. and was “ready for a fresh challenge.” He gave no clear reason for his departure nor hint of his destination.
A company spokesman said in an email that when Google’s self-driving car project began seven years ago, “the idea that a car could drive itself wasn’t much more than an idea. Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this life-saving technology will soon become a reality. He departs with our warmest wishes.”
Separately, the
reported that two other top engineers, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, were leaving the project, which now resides in Alphabet’s research lab dubbed X, to start a new company. The spokesman declined to comment on the reported departure of Messrs. Ferguson and Zhu.
Another co-founder of Google’s self-driving car project, Anthony Levandowski, left earlier this year
.
Computers have driven dozens of Google cars more than 1.8 million miles on U.S. roads over the past several years. Data from California regulators show that Google cars are far more reliable than most other driverless-car prototypes on the road today, as test drivers have to take control of the Google vehicles far less often than driverless cars tested by other auto makers and tech firms. Mr. Urmson directed the Google project until last year, when auto-industry veteran 



      John Krafcik



       took over as chief executive as part of an effort to commercialize the technology.
Mr. Krafcik said on Twitter: “Chris is an incredible colleague & leader. Thank you for your passion & humility. Good luck on your new adventures!”
Mr. Urmson’s departure now means there are few founding members left on the project as it enters its potentially thorniest period: navigating regulators and the auto industry to bring driverless-car technology to market.
Mr. Urmson has been a strong advocate of releasing only fully automated driverless-car technology versus the semiautomated systems that enable passengers to take control of the car, such as the technology currently available on many

vehicles. Such semiautonomous technology was steering a Tesla car when it crashed in Florida earlier this year, killing the driver.
Mr. Urmson and others at Alphabet say it is unsafe to enable people to take control of a vehicle after minutes of inaction. Indeed, Alphabet is testing a prototype that includes no steering wheel nor brake pedal. Mr. Urmson has said his goal is to remove people from driving altogether because human error contributes to 94% of car crashes.
However, that approach makes it far more difficult to bring the technology to market. Regulators and the public remain hesitant at taking humans out of the loop completely. Industry analysts expect self-driving technology to be introduced gradually instead, as with the Tesla system.
Mr. Krafcik, the Google project’s CEO, told Bloomberg in an interview published this week that the fatal Tesla crash “confirms our sense that the route to full autonomy, though much harder, is the right route.”
Mr. Urmson, a Canadian who got his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University, was the technical leader of the school’s three entries in the Defense Department’s 2005 “Grand Challenge” contest to have cars drive autonomously across the desert and then in a city environment. Carnegie Mellon’s team won the 2007 Urban Challenge and, two years later, Mr. Urmson joined Google, recruited by 



      Sebastian Thrun, 



       who had been Stanford University’s team leader and was earlier a professor at Carnegie Mellon.
Mr. Thrun, in an interview earlier this year, said Mr. Urmson was a “brilliant” programmer. Before starting work on the Grand Challenges, he had been working on slow-moving robots that could explore Mars on their own.
“I’ve decided the time is right to step down and find my next adventure,” Mr. Urmson said in the blog post. “It has been a tremendous privilege and honor to be part of a team that has been at the forefront of bringing this life-saving technology to the world…I have every confidence that the mission is in capable hands.”

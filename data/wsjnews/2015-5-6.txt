  Tesla Buys Michigan Auto-Parts Maker

    Electric-car maker purchases Riviera Tool, a maker of stamping die systems

has agreed to buy a Michigan auto parts maker, Riviera Tool LLC, for an undisclosed amount.
The Grand Rapids, Mich., company makes stamping die systems used to create body panels. Tesla confirmed the agreement to buy the company after a report in the Detroit Free Press. The company has about 100 workers, which Tesla intends to keep, according to the newspaper.
Tesla confirmed the purchase of the privately held company and not a formerly publicly traded company of nearly the same name. Some investors have attempted to trade the security on Thursday even though it has been inactive for several years.
News of the acquisition came hours after the company reported a $154 million loss in the first quarter because of heavy spending related to expanding the company and launching its Model X sport-utility vehicle.
The acquisition is a sign of Tesla’s growing scale and ambition. Tesla makes its Model S and forthcoming Model X out of aluminum, which is difficult to stamp and requires special expertise. Tesla brings expertise and the ability to make its own dies in-house with the move.

  Tesla CEO Elon Musk Unveils Line of Home and Industrial Battery Packs

    ‘We’re talking about trying to change the fundamental energy infrastructure of the world,’ Musk says

HAWTHORNE, Calif.—


Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       unveiled a line of home and industrial battery packs late Thursday, representing a strategic shift as his money-losing electric car company tries to break into a crowded energy storage market.
More than just a splashy evening party in a hangar at Tesla’s Southern California design studios, the event was the 43-year-old billionaire’s attempt to bring attention to an alternative business unit that has long been under development.
Mr. Musk says “power wall” batteries—ranging from a $3,000 7 kilowatt-hour wall-mounted unit to a $3,500 10 kwh unit—cost far less than the going rate for large-scale batteries and can be easier to install. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Tesla aims to begin delivering units by the summer from its California car factory, and later shift production to a $5 billion battery plant under construction near Reno, Nev.
Tesla also will sell massive battery blocks for industrial users and open-source the patents for the entire range, much like the company does with electric-car technology. Mr. Musk portrayed the effort as a breakthrough toward transforming energy use in favor of renewable resources.
“We’re talking about trying to change the fundamental energy infrastructure of the world,” he said during a public unveiling. “This is actually within the power of humanity to do. It is not impossible.”
Mr. Musk sees the potential for the battery business to match or surpass Tesla’s car business in terms of the potential for energy generation. He expects demand to range from countries where solar is popular, such as Germany, to developing economies that don’t have existing power lines.
Eventually, he expects Tesla will need to build more factories modeled after its Nevada factory.
Tesla’s first battery customers include Green Mountain Power Corp., Vermont’s largest utility. It plans to buy Tesla packs and sell them to customers that already have solar power.
Green Mountain Power Chief Executive 



      Mary Powell



       said she thinks the rapid spread of solar power, combined with lower battery costs, will lead a revolution in power distribution.
Another customer is TreeHouse Inc., an Austin-based home improvement store concentrating on ecologically friendly goods. The store will sell the battery packs along with its own solar installation options.
A new market is growing for robust batteries. Initially developed for electric cars, they are now being installed at buildings, wind farms and other places that can store electricity for later use. Tesla said its home products can be configured as a backup device, or to buy power at night when prices are cheap and discharge it during the day, or store power collected from solar panels for later use.
About 62 megawatts of batteries and other energy-storage devices were installed in 2014 at 180 properties, at a value of about $128 million, up 40% from the previous year, according to energy research firm GTM Research. Battery installations this year are likely to more than triple, to 220 megawatts, the firm predicts.
Utilities such as
and
have installed large battery systems next to wind farms. The batteries store electricity that the wind turbines generate at night and release the power to the grid in the late afternoon and early evening when electricity demand spikes.
Other companies, such as Stem Inc. and Green Charge Networks are installing batteries for large retailers and hotels, to help the companies limit their power usage and cut their utility bills.


Government subsidies can reduce the cost of installing the batteries. In California, state rebates cover up to 60% of the price of the battery. Nationwide, batteries that are connected to solar panels are eligible for federal tax credits equal to 30% of the price of the battery.
California’s subsidies and a mandate requiring utilities to use batteries or other devices to store power have put that state at the center of the stationary energy-storage market. Hawaii, Texas and some eastern states also are using batteries to store electricity from solar panels and wind farms, and to keep the flow of electricity on transmission lines moving smoothly.
Tesla batteries initially will use cells made by

, the supplier of batteries in its Model S electric sedan. When production shifts to Reno, costs will drop by 30%, it estimates.
The new battery models include large, standing industrial-level batteries intended for use by utilities sold in units of 100 kilowatt-hours, which cost $250 per kilowatt-hour. The company already has a customer with plans to install 250 megawatt-hours-worth of such batteries, Mr. Musk said.
Its home model, called “power wall,” comes in sleek black and white models and will be aimed at people who want to more efficiently use power from solar panels or go entirely off the electrical grid, Mr. Musk said. The larger home model can store enough electricity to power a home for 10 hours, Tesla said.
The Power Wall batteries will be installed through certified third parties, including

, where Mr. Musk is chairman.

Deal of the Week/By   Eliot Brown    Eliot Brown  The Wall Street Journal  Biography Eliot Brown  @eliotwb  Eliot.Brown@wsj.com/May 5, 2015 8:30 a.m. ET/Real Estate
            


              
                
                    Deal of the Week
                
              


      

    


  

  Lennar Bets on Silicon Valley’s Spread

    Developer bought 111-acre parcel for project in East Bay city of Fremont, Calif.

With office and residential space in San Francisco and Silicon Valley becoming scarcer by the day, the East Bay city of Fremont, Calif., is girding for some spillover.
Last week,

completed a deal to buy a 111-acre chunk of a former car-manufacturing plant in Fremont, 30 miles southeast of San Francisco, where it plans a dense mix of 2,200 apartments and houses, research-and-development space and offices, all centered around a new station for the commuter rail that leads to San Francisco.
The move by Lennar, along with a handful of other developers that have bought smaller parcels nearby, appears to be a bet that the former manufacturing area can be transformed into a thriving downtown-like environment that feeds in part off the expansion of

which owns a factory adjacent to Lennar’s parcel.
“This is a highly desirable site,” said 



      Gordon Jones, 



       Lennar’s Bay Area division president. “It’s in a constrained housing market in proximity to well-paying jobs and easy access to transit.”
The plans in Fremont show how communities and investors throughout the Bay Area are trying to capitalize on the rapid growth that has so far been concentrated in San Francisco and cities to the south in Silicon Valley. With traffic and other congestion concerns mounting in those communities, cities in the East Bay have high hopes.
“We’re looking forward to seeing some of that growth come to this side of the bay,” said 



      Jessica von Borck, 



       Fremont’s assistant city manager.
Other East Bay cities are seeing new development as well. The University of California, Berkeley is planning a campus with some private investment in the suburb of Richmond, in the northern reaches of the East Bay. In San Ramon to the east, the owner of the giant office park Bishop Ranch is planning a large, dense mixed-use expansion.
And in Santa Clara, in the southern reaches of Silicon Valley, Related Cos. is planning a multibillion-dollar mixed-use development meant to attract expanding companies looking for modern office space.
Of course, it is far from clear that lots of businesses will flock to any of these developments, let alone all of them. Despite the growth of the tech sector, the East Bay has long struggled to attract top businesses to expand or move, and historically it has more been a hub of back-office jobs and manufacturing, due in part to its distance from wealthy suburbs north and south of San Francisco.
In addition, the entire Bay Area is known for its booms and busts, and today’s boom surely isn’t going to continue forever.
For Fremont, the deal by Lennar represents the culmination a planning effort and push that started in 2010, after a giant auto plant jointly owned by

and

closed.
The car makers sold part of the facility to Tesla, and then sold a parcel to railroad

, which planned to use it as a rail yard.
But that vision was at odds with that of city planners, who saw the plant’s closure as an opportunity to bring new development and attract new employers.
So a set of city officials flew out to Omaha, Neb., to lobby the chief executive of Union Pacific on their vision, Ms. von Borck said. The land could be more valuable with other uses, the officials said, particularly given that the Bay Area Rapid Transit rail was being extended and Tesla’s popularity was growing.
Shortly thereafter, Union Pacific shifted course and put the land up for sale, settling on Lennar as a buyer. Lennar then crafted a plan, received city approvals and completed the deal last week. The price wasn’t disclosed, but Union Pacific said in a statement it would recognize a gain of $110 million on the deal.
For Lennar, the purchase adds to its portfolio of large-scale projects in the Bay Area.
It is seeking to build two giant housing developments in San Francisco—one on an island between San Francisco and Oakland and the other in a former shipyard.
Lennar’s Mr. Jones said the company’s interest in the region comes as “the Bay Area combines an extremely robust job market with a tight housing market—creating significant opportunity for home builders.”
Like the two projects in San Francisco, the Fremont development has considerable upfront infrastructure costs. Lennar is expected to spend up to $100 million on infrastructure including roads, open space and a school. Lennar plans to spend about $1 billion on the residential portions of the project, while it plans to sell off the commercial sites to other developers.
That initial investment is slated to start as soon as this summer, according to Fremont’s Ms. von Borck, with the total build-out expected to happen over 15 years. For now, demand appears strong.
“We happen to be at a really good spot in the market,” she said.

  Tesla Pledges to Meet China Charging Standards

    Luxury electric-car maker would adapt its  vehicles to meet future requirements

SHANGHAI—


said it would modify its battery-powered electric cars to meet China’s charging standards to allay concerns over its technology’s incompatibility in the country, where the company’s sales have fallen short of its expectations.
China is developing a national charging standard to promote the use of electric cars and reduce “range anxiety” over how far the cars can travel before running out of power. It remains unclear when the standard will be completed.
The lack of sufficient charging infrastructure and Tesla’s current technology incompatibility with the Chinese government-initiated charging network are holding Chinese buyers back, analysts say. Tesla last year
at no cost to other car makers.
Statistics from U.S. research firm JL Warren Capital show that fewer than 2,500 Tesla cars were registered in China in the nine months from April 2014, when the company started deliveries there. Tesla Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       told The Wall Street Journal a year ago that he would consider it a success if Tesla were to sell 5,000 vehicles or more in China in 2014.
Tesla declined to comment on the registration figures. The company
after missing sales targets.
The American electric car maker has dished out millions of dollars to install so-called supercharging stations around the world to appeal to buyers worried about infrastructure. These direct-current chargers can deliver 120 kilowatts of electricity and recharge 80% of a 85 kilowatt-hour Model S battery in 30 minutes.
However, its rapid-charge technology isn’t compatible with electric cars built by other manufacturers, raising concerns among Chinese consumers about the lack of access to charge Tesla cars.
In a statement posted on its website on Monday, Tesla said it would modify its cars to fit Chinese national charging standards. “We will fully cooperate with the Chinese government in drafting the national charging standards as well as building public charging infrastructure,” Zhu Xiaotong, country head for Tesla in China, said in the statement.
The Chinese government has said it won’t support the construction of charging stations that fail to meet the emerging Chinese standard.

last year struck a deal with the city government of Shanghai to build charging stations that can supply electricity for cars by other manufacturers.
Tesla’s statement comes as China itself struggles to meet its own long-stated goal of reducing its dependency on imported oil by promoting alternative-energy vehicles. China wants half a million such vehicles on the road by the end of this year and 10 times that by the end of the decade. Last year around 50,000 cars out of the roughly 20 million passenger vehicles sold in China met that criteria.

  Maryland Allows Direct Sales by Tesla; FTC Urges Michigan to Do So

    Electric-car maker has had to battle car dealers who oppose manufacturer-owned dealerships

is allowed to sell cars through four of its own retail stores in Maryland after Gov. 



      Larry Hogan



       signed a bill making way for manufacturer-owned dealerships under limited circumstances.
This decision comes as Tesla’s direct-sales model is also a topic in Michigan, which outlawed direct sales in October.
For several years, Tesla has had to battle in every state car dealers who are bent on making its manufacturer-to-consumer sales method illegal.
Maryland’s law allows Tesla to operate four locations, and it is patterned after states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Georgia, which have allowed the electric-vehicle maker to sell cars out of its stores as long as there is a cap. All these laws also are narrowly focused on the type of manufacturer that is eligible, so that they mostly apply only to Tesla.
Last week, the Federal Trade Commission’s staff sent a letter to a Michigan state senator urging him to include a provision in a bill he had sponsored that would allow Tesla to operate in Michigan. That bill seeks to open the door to direct sales for Elio Motors, a startup that is trying to launch a three-wheeled car that is expected to attain up to 84 miles per gallon on the highway.
At the time of the passage of the law, Gov. 



      Rick Snyder



       said he hoped the legislature would address the issue again. A spokesman for the governor didn’t respond Tuesday to a request for comment on the letter.
It isn’t the first time the FTC has weighed in on the issue. The commission staff previously had written similar position pieces protesting efforts by some states to restrict Tesla’s direct sales.
In many states, Tesla has come to an accommodation with dealers by agreeing to limit the number of stores in the state.
Maryland had only allowed “galleries,” which are like showrooms for vehicles but the staff isn’t allowed to sell the vehicles and can’t handle any paperwork. Connecticut also has a prohibition on direct sales but its legislature is moving forward on a compromise bill to allow sales.
“I would like to think we are reaching the point of general agreement around the principles we’ve been espousing,” said 



      Diarmuid O’Connell, 



       vice president of business development for Tesla.
In addition to Connecticut, Texas, Arizona, Michigan and West Virginia all have laws prohibiting direct sales by manufacturers. The Texas legislature, which meets only every two years, has a House and Senate bill that would allow up to 12 retail locations in the state. But since its February introduction, little action has occurred on the bill.

  Tesla’s Battery Could Power Utilities

    Elon Musk’s new battery packs are a threat to utilities, but they also represent an opportunity to maintain relevance

Elon Musk



       had to resist the urge to strike a Dr. Evil pose Thursday night as he talked about “billions” of batteries like

’ new Powerpack effectively ending the energy business as we know it.
But depending on how the heads of traditional power suppliers respond, they could be the ones who end up laughing “MWAH HA HA.”

, the new battery arm of the electric-vehicle maker that Mr. Musk heads, represents a moment for the distributed-energy industry, albeit not a breakthrough. Its lithium-ion technology is the same well-established one inside Tesla’s Model S car and just one of several competing chemistries.
But Tesla may be taking a page from Apple’s book. Decades ago, Apple took a technically difficult tool used mainly by die-hards, the personal computer, and popularized it. In the same way, Tesla’s sleekly packaged take on distributed power is “talking to the 99% of people who think it can’t be done and making something people think can be done,” says 



      Rob Day, 



       partner at Black Coral Capital, a clean technology venture-capital fund.
Like its cars, though, Tesla’s battery is too expensive right now for mass adoption. The bigger near-term opportunity will be businesses that often pay punitive utility fees when demand is high. A battery could help offset that. The proposition becomes even more enticing when coupled with software that helps companies better manage their energy usage. This means they could use a smaller, cheaper battery.
For utilities, though, batteries
over the long term. Right now, the grid and power stations are the battery, providing power on demand. When that demand shifts to a customer-controlled battery, the utility sells less electricity.
Alternatively, utilities could get on board. While their instinct is often to slow the adoption of distributed energy—for example, in the form of special charges for solar-panel owners—this is politically difficult. And, over time, it actually encourages grid defection.
Instead, utilities could join with Tesla, or its many competitors, to install batteries at a large scale in their service areas. They could be compensated through the existing model of spreading the cost across customers’ bills, while meeting renewable-power obligations. Batteries, by storing surplus solar power, also address any lingering perceptions about distributed generation destabilizing the grid.
For Tesla, selling in bulk to utilities would be a faster route to boosting demand for batteries. From that, it would reap economies of scale. Such a future is probably not what many of Tesla’s true believers had in mind as they cheered on Thursday night: Distributed energy is supposed to be about individual empowerment.
But don’t be surprised if some utilities embrace batteries. They could prove a means to effectively maintain control of what distributed energy threatens to take away from them: the customer.

  Tesla Shares Down on Cash Supply Concern

    Electric auto maker burned through $558 million in cash last quarter

shares began dropping Thursday—even after an earnings report Wednesday after the market closed that appeared to be better than Wall Street expected—because the company’s cash supply is dwindling.
Shares declined 2% to $228 near the opening on the


By most metrics, Tesla
. Its gross margins were on target, its revenue, up 55% from a year ago, was better than forecast and its adjusted losses were 36 cents a share, much better than the 50-cent loss forecast.
But the auto maker burned through $558 million in cash, an amount called “eye watering” by
analyst 



      Adam Jonas



       as the company poured money into its Fremont, Calif. plant ahead of the launch of the Model X sport-utility.
Mr. Jonas, who is a big believer in Tesla, was especially concerned because Tesla’s forecast for the second and third quarters indicates the company’s cash burn could be just as large, setting up a scenario where the company runs out of gross cash unless it borrows more.
“Does Tesla have nine months of gross cash left? (Second quarter) cash burn looks equally as deep or higher, leaving the company with less than $1 (billion) gross cash at midyear, just before the Model X intro," he said in a note to investors.
Tesla took out a line of credit during the quarter for $100 million, and drew down $78 million of it. The company also said it planned to close on more financing soon. Furthermore, CEO 



      Elon Musk



       said the company would have strong positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter when the sport-utility was in full production.
Still, if the Model X launch isn’t smooth and the company can’t deliver a large number of vehicles in the fourth quarter, the cash supply could dwindle quickly, especially as spending on the company’s giant battery factory in Reno, Nev., ramps up.
Most of the big spending on the $5 billion plant hasn’t yet begun, according to the chief financial officer, 



      Deepak Ahuja.



       The big spending in the quarter was to prepare for the Model X launch.
In February, he said the company should be able to finance its ambitious growth without significantly diluting existing shareholders. Last year, the company borrowed $2.3 billion through a convertible bond offering. That debt can be converted into new stock, which can lower the value of existing shares.


Tesla could borrow money in the form of a traditional bond, but because it isn’t profitable and is burning cash, it likely would pay a high interest rate.
Mr. Musk estimated that sales in the fourth quarter would be roughly double that of the other quarters—or more than 20,000. But that came with a caveat.
“I do want to emphasize that, like sometimes people don’t totally appreciate is that, there are several thousand unique parts in a car and if even one of those parts is not available for any reason, then you cannot ship, you cannot scale production,” Mr. Musk said in a call with investors. “So essentially, the production ramp goes according to the unluckiest and worst performing supplier or project of Tesla.”
Ryan Brinkman, 



       the equity analyst for

called the cash burn “disquietingly large” and lowered his estimate for the company’s stock to $163 from $165.
analyst 



      Colin Langan



       cut his full-year adjusted profit forecast to $1 per share from $1.40.

analyst 



      Brian Johnson



       suggested Tesla might be better off just being a battery supplier for stationary storage because of the worsening results in automotive.
“We see this result as likely to reverse the positive trajectory the shares enjoyed going into the stationary storage announcement,” he said.

  The Most Innovative Cordless and Gas Lawn Mowers

    From cutting-edge cordless to classic gas models, the latest lawn mowers are putting the machine’s clunky image out to pasture. A look at the Cub Cadet RZT S Zero, Troy-Bilt TB230, Toro Recycler with SmartStow and Worx WG771

of Americans who love their lawn but not necessarily mowing it, there’s good news: We’re in the midst of a great lawn-mower renaissance. The same electric-craze that’s revolutionizing the auto industry is now trickling down to the suburban lawn. Just a few years ago, you couldn’t find a cordless electric mower with enough power or stamina to trim anything bigger than a townhouse backyard. But thanks to advances in lithium-ion battery chemistry, these quieter machines have muscled up and boosted their run time considerably. While cordless mowers once maxed out at about 24 volts, today’s versions have batteries packing over three times that, with some using multiple batteries to maximize run time. At last, electric is delivering performance on par with that of gas-guzzlers, with enough power to shear even expanses of tall wet grass.
Never having to refill a mower’s gas tank, change its oil or yank on a pull cord again has its appeal, but that doesn’t mean the gas-powered mower is dead. When it comes to tackling thick, overgrown grass—the sort you might find after returning from a summer vacation—the torque from a gas engine still can’t be beat. And even these tried-and-true mowers are evolving. Because of stricter emission regulations enacted by organizations like the California Air Resources Board, gas mowers are running cleaner than ever. And instead of pushing the limits of engine power, manufacturers are focusing on convenience, with designs that
that have plagued mower owners for decades, including maintenance and storage issues.
So if you dedicate one morning each weekend to maintaining your patch of heaven, take a look below at the most innovative offerings available this season. We trimmed the list down to four models that are a cut above the rest.
This electric ride-on is the first of its kind. Powered by four 12-volt batteries (which recharge via a standard electrical outlet), this Tesla of the mower world provides up to an hour of run time and uses the latest brushless motors, which are more efficient and require less maintenance than traditional brushed motors. Like an electric car, this American-built mower is much quieter than a gas model: When zipping across a lawn (top speed is 6 mph), it sounds like one of those Power Wheels trucks for children. With the blades engaged, the noise reaches 82 decibels, which is about as loud as a blender. The RZT is a so-called “zero-turn” mower, which means it can pivot on a dime and pull off a 180-degree switchback. Every commercial mower with this feature relies on unintuitive lap bars for steering, but the RZT uses a carlike steering wheel.

In terms of raw power, a gas-engine mower is your best bet, but it is more of a pain to maintain than its electric cousin. The most cumbersome upkeep chore, by far: changing the oil. This task might require fussing with a hard-to-reach drain plug or tipping the machine over and praying that the oil ends up in the drain pan rather than on your garage floor. Thankfully, the Troy-Bilt TB230 makes this messy task a thing of the past. All you have to do is top off the initial 15 ounces of oil from time to time. The secret? A specially designed engine that keeps the oil cleaner and cooler. Instead of the small, square air filter found on most mowers, this one’s has more surface area to block particulates, while an internal fan and cylinder heads keep the oil about 10 degrees cooler than a typical mower. The TB230 also has you covered on the job: Front-wheel drive pulls the mower along at up to 3.25 mph.

This self-propelled, walk-behind mower solves an outsize problem for homeowners with small garages or sheds: How to prevent your mower from hogging floor space during the six days a week that it isn’t in use. The SmartStow folds to store vertically. Simply fold the handle down by unlocking a pair of knobs at the base, then pivot the body of the mower up so it sits on its 11-inch rear wheels. In this position, the SmartStow takes up about a third less space than a conventional 22-inch mower. Thanks to its Briggs & Stratton-designed leakproof carburetor and taller oil-fill tube, gasoline and oil stay put instead of dripping onto the floor. The upright position also makes it easier to remove the blade for sharpening. The SmartStow is a star on the field, as well: It’s relatively high rear wheels enable easy pivoting when you reach the end of a strip.

By using a slightly-shorter-than-normal 19-inch blade and a pair of 56-volt lithium-ion batteries, this cordless electric push-mower has a longer run time than similar models. Charge it up for two hours and you’ll have enough juice to cut about a quarter acre of lawn. But the superior handling and usability really put this model over the top. Caster wheels out front allow you to turn the deck with minimal effort, so you can breeze in and out of corners, weave around trees and trim the perimeter of curvy flower beds. The wheels lock in at any of seven cutting positions, from 1.25 to 4 inches high, making it possible to zero in on the perfect height grass. This mower is also especially easy to clean: The deck has a quick-connect port for a garden hose. Post mow, attach the hose, turn on the water and spin the blade for a few seconds to flush out any clippings that might still be clinging on.



The Cub Cadet RZT S Zero is powered by 12-volt batteries. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the batteries were 48 volts. The earlier version also incorrectly referred to the Toro Recycler with SmartStow as the Toro SmartStow Recycler. (May 1, 2015)

  Tesla Launches Used Car Sales Via Web

    Luxury electric auto maker gears up for rash of Model S cars coming off lease this summer

Electric-car maker


has begun selling used versions of its Model S electric cars on its website, an important step for the luxury car maker as its business matures.
Its certified vehicle program, which Tesla launched without fanfare late last month, allows buyers to obtain Tesla’s cars at a lower price than its new vehicles, and comes with the manufacturer’s maintenance and reliability checks. Like other luxury car makers, Tesla offers a 4-year or 50,000-mile limited warranty on its used cars.
The first batch of vehicles available for sale on the site are mostly cars whose owners swapped them for the all-wheel-drive Model S that went on sale late last year, a company spokeswoman said. Leased vehicles will begin to return to Tesla next year as the very first cars were sold in the middle of 2012 and leases began in early 2013 and generally were written for three years.
Used sales are important to Tesla to gain new customers, ensure residual values are stable and as a source of revenue.
Tesla doesn’t use independent dealers, so it keeps the revenue from the sales of its used vehicles. Typically, used vehicles produce higher profit margins than new car sales at traditional new-car dealerships.
In Tesla’s case, it is unclear how much profit the sales will generate. Offerings on its website last week generally were less costly than those advertised through AutoTrader.com by private sellers or used car dealers. With a limited supply of these vehicles nationally, Tesla’s site recently had offerings in 11 U.S. metropolitan areas.
“There are a whole new set of buyers potentially exposed to the brand now,” said 



      Alec Gutierrez, 



       an analyst with automotive researcher Kelley Blue Book.
Other car makers, particularly luxury brands such as
and Mercedes-Benz, have been successful with certified preowned vehicle sales. They give consumers comfort in buying used cars because of the manufacturers’ guarantees. In turn, the demand for the used vehicles helps push residual values higher and that lowers the lease price for new cars.
One quirk, however, of Tesla’s new system is how the company handles its used car inventory. Today, Tesla has very few new cars sitting in showrooms and those that are there are mostly demonstration models. With the used car program, it will be getting hundreds or thousands of cars returned from leases annually, and will have to store the vehicles until they are sold.
A Tesla spokeswoman said the cars will be kept in groups around the country, not necessarily at a retail store, but at a Tesla location. If a customer orders a used car, they can either go to the regional storage spots to retrieve it, or have it delivered to their home by Tesla.

  Tesla’s Musk Says Model X Won’t Hit Market Until Late Third Quarter

    Electric vehicle maker chief says heavily anticipated SUV still in process of validating

The group of buyers expecting to get their hands on


next product—the Model X—need to cool their jets a little bit longer. The SUV appears to be hitting another delay, but the CEO says it is for good reason.
During a call with investors, Tesla Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       said Tesla is still in the process of validating the Model X, which follows the Model S sedan, which launched in 2012. To get the Model X on the way, “millions of miles of travel testing” needs to be completed.
The Model X is heavily anticipated, but has been subject to
. In its first-quarter earnings report, the Silicon Valley electric vehicle maker
In February, the company indicated the Model X would be on sale by mid-July.
Mr. Musk said it isn’t worth splitting hairs over. “The thing that really matters is not when do the first deliveries of the Model X occur,” but investors should pay attention to when significant volume is ramped up.
“It would be easy for us to kind of do some initial deliveries in August, that would be pretty easy,” he said. “We want to iron everything out, make sure everything is good.”
Mr. Musk said Tesla will first build a “captive fleet” of Model X SUVs before it actually releases them for sale. This is a process similar to the batch-and-release tradition employed by more established auto makers when they launch a new vehicle.
Tesla’s CEO also shed more light on the company’s Model 3 car, a cheaper model aimed at a broader audience. He said Tesla plans to unveil a prototype of the car next March, and put the vehicle on sale late in 2017.

  Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks Fall

MARKETS AT A GLANCE
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT:
U.S. stocks fell after Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen drew attention to elevated valuations in the equity market. U.S. government bonds sold off for the eighth consecutive session. The dollar fell against the euro. Oil prices gained on a report showing a decline in U.S. stockpiles. Gold prices slipped ahead of Friday’s U.S. employment report.
OPENING CALL:
Investors in Australia will get the latest reading on the nation’s economy with the release of the April labor-market report. The economy added 37,700 new jobs in March, outpacing economists’ expectations of a rise of 15,000 and lowering the unemployment rate to 6.1%, the lowest since December. On Tuesday, Australia’s central bank cut interest rates to a fresh record low of 2.0%, hoping to give a jolt to an economy that’s suffering from the end of a decadelong mining boom.
EQUITIES:
U.S. stocks fell after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen drew attention to elevated valuations in the equity market.
Ms. Yellen made the remarks in a conversation with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde, who asked the central bank chief about the possibility that the Fed’s rock-bottom interest-rate policy was leading to bubbles in financial markets.
The declines capped a volatile session for stocks, which rose at the opening bell, then reversed course within the first half hour of trading. The losses snowballed following Ms. Yellen’s remarks, with the Dow falling as much as 195 points, before paring losses.
“Risks to financial stability are moderated, not elevated at this point, “ Ms. Yellen said, though she added that stock-market valuations appear “quite high” and some bond and loan markets suggest investors may be taking excess risks.
Investors seized on the warning, which comes amid a recent spate of negative economic headlines and one of the weakest quarterly earnings seasons in several years. Trading volumes were elevated, with more than 7 billion shares trading hands.
“You came in hoping for a reason to buy stocks, and the market hasn’t given us that for a while,” said Larry Weiss, head of trading at brokerage Instinet in New York. “When something comes out [from the central bank] that’s unscripted, or surprises people, people definitely use it as an excuse” to trade.
The comments weren’t the first time Ms. Yellen has raised concerns about the risks of high valuations in the stock market. Last July, in a biannual report to Congress, the central bank sounded alarm about lofty prices of social-media and biotechnology stocks, prompting a short-lived pullback in those sectors.
The pullback marked the second consecutive day of losses for major stock benchmarks, the latest move in a sideways year for stocks. The Dow is up just 0.1% for the year, and has fallen 2.4% from its last record close reached in early April. The S&P 500 is up 1% for the year, but down 1.8% from its late-April record.
Above-average stock valuations have for years been a concern for investors as the bull-market in equities enters its sixth year. The S&P 500 index now trades at 17.5 times the last 12 months of earnings, according to FactSet. The 10-year average P/E ratio for the index is 15.8.
Ms. Yellen’s latest warning over valuations is the latest cause for hand-wringing by investors, following a raft of data suggesting the U.S. has entered an economic rough patch. Last week, the Commerce Department said gross domestic product grew at a paltry 0.2% pace in the first quarter, while the country’s trade deficit widened.
At the same time, earnings growth all but stalled in the first quarter. With 417 companies reporting first-quarter results, earnings among companies in the S&P 500 are on pace to grow just 0.2%, according to FactSet. Still, that’s better than the forecast for a 4.7% decline in earnings at the end of March.
First-quarter earnings reports prompted some moves by individual stocks. Chesapeake Energy Corp. said Wednesday it had swung to a loss in the first quarter as the shale driller took a $3.6 billion write-down. Excluding the impairment and other special charges, profit came in above expectations. Shares fell 7.2%.
Mylan NV said Tuesday its revenue rose a less-than-expected 9%, as foreign currency and acquisition costs weighed on results. The company affirmed its full-year outlook. Shares fell 2.5%.
Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. has agreed to buy Synageva BioPharma Corp. in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $8.4 billion. Alexion shares fell 8%, while those of Synageva surged 112%.
Shares in Shanghai tumbled for a second day, pushing losses on the market’s benchmark index to 5.6% in two sessions, with comments by state-media failing to prop up the market on Wednesday, while Australia’s market fell to a three-month low amid worse-than-expected earnings from the country’s largest bank.
FOREX:
The dollar dropped against the euro after lackluster employment data heralded a sluggish start for the U.S. economy in the second quarter.
Higher bond yields for countries in the eurozone have also given the euro a boost. Bond yields rise as their prices fall. Yields for bonds climbed in Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal.
Soft U.S. economic data have buffeted the dollar for much of the past couple of months, discouraging investors who had piled into the U.S. currency in the hope that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates around the middle of this year. On Wednesday, payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody’s Analytics said the U.S. private sector added 169,000 jobs in April, which was below expectations. The report raised concerns that the April nonfarm payrolls report, due Friday, would also be weak.
“For the dollar to move in a strengthening trend, you need confirmation in the near term that the Fed will raise rates,” said Mark McCormick, currency strategist at Credit Agricole. “But if the data continue to soften and that doesn’t happen, then the dollar will continue to struggle.”
Higher interest rates make the dollar more attractive to yield-hungry investors. The Fed has left borrowing costs pinned near zero since 2008, but it has signaled it would tighten monetary policy when it sees improvement in the economy, particularly in the labor market.
BONDS:
U.S. government bonds sold off for an eighth consecutive session, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to nearly the highest level of the year.
It was the Treasury bond market’s longest losing streak since March 2011. The yield on Germany’s 10-year government debt climbed to the highest level since December. Bond prices fall as their yields rise.
The selloff underscores the risk bond investors, who have benefited from capital gains over the past year, are facing when sentiment sours. Even a moderate rise in bond yields--and a corresponding fall in prices--could more than offset income from paltry interest payments.
Concerns have been growing lately over whether the bond market’s valuation is getting stretched. The angst has been the most pronounced in German government debt, where the 10-year yield tumbled to near zero in late April, driven by the ECB’s stimulus.
“We are in a correction,” said Larry Milstein, head of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. in New York.
The magnitude of the selloff reminds some investors of the taper tantrum of the summer of 2013, when bond markets were rattled by worries over reduced bond buying from the Federal Reserve.
Concerns over liquidity--the ease with which investors sell or buy a financial asset--have been growing among global investors across a broad arena of assets, ranging from bonds to currencies to stocks.
Major central banks through their asset-purchase programs have mopped up a large amount of high-grade government debt out of the secondary markets following the financial crisis. Tighter banking regulations have reduced banks’ willingness to be the middlemen for investors.
The International Monetary Fund warned last month that the Federal Reserve could spark widespread volatility in global financial markets if its move to raise interest rates surprises markets.
Demand for haven bonds has diminished lately. Fears over a deflation scare also dialed back, sapping demand for haven bonds. Crude-oil prices have rallied from a six-year low, inflation expectations in both the U.S. and eurozone have bounced from multiyear low levels, and some economic releases out of the eurozone have shown improvement.
The nonfarm jobs release due Friday is a bellwether indicator of the labor market. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expect 228,000 new jobs were added last month, sharply rebounding from 126,000 in March.
COMMODITIES:
Oil prices spiked in a volatile session as weekly data showed U.S. stockpiles fell for the first time this year, but the market gave back much of its gains amid a continued bearish backdrop.
U.S. oil inventories fell 3.9 million barrels last week, the first weekly decline since Dec. 26, according to data provided by the U.S. Department of Energy. The decrease sent a surprisingly bullish signal to the market that the monthslong growth in supplies may finally be ebbing, and prices briefly touched a new high for the year.
The data showed strong demand for crude from refineries, which ramped up processing rates to produce gasoline in anticipation of the summer driving season set to kick off in a few weeks. The decline in stockpiles stood in contrast to the 1.1 million-barrel increase projected in a survey of analysts by The Wall Street Journal and was even larger than the 1.5 million barrel draw reported by the industry trade group American Petroleum Institute.
“The inventory data is really shaking the bearish argument that supplies are just going to keep going up,” said Phil Flynn, an account executive at brokerage Price Futures Group in Chicago.
But the data contained other notes that sent caution signals to the market. For one, it showed a sharp drop in imports for the week, which analysts said played a big role in the overall stockpile decline and would likely revert to normal in the coming weeks. And for another, domestic oil production remains robust at more than 9.3 million barrels a day--declining by just 4,000 in the weekly data--and commercial crude inventories remain near record highs, at 487 million barrels.
The benchmark U.S. oil contract jumped as high as 3.6% after the data release, but gave back much of the gains over the course of the session.
“You mustn’t get confused between weekly changes (in data) and the fact that stocks are very, very high,” said Gareth Lewis-Davies, a crude oil strategist at BNP Paribas in London. “There’s an excess of crude that has to dissipate.”
The data showed a mixed picture for refined products. Gasoline stockpiles rose less than expected, climbing 401,000 barrels to 227.9 million barrels. But distillate stocks, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, rose by 1.5 million barrels to 130.8 million barrels, when analysts were expecting a 200,000-barrel decrease in inventories.
In the precious metals market, gold prices fell, giving up earlier gains as investors grew cautious ahead of Friday’s U.S. employment data.

  Does Artificial Intelligence Pose a Threat?

    A panel of experts discusses the prospect of machines capable of autonomous reasoning

Paging Sarah Connor!
After decades as a sci-fi staple, artificial intelligence has leapt into the mainstream. Between

Siri and

Alexa,


Watson and
Brain, machines that understand the world and respond productively suddenly seem imminent.
The combination of immense Internet-connected networks and machine-learning algorithms has yielded dramatic advances in machines’ ability to understand spoken and visual communications, capabilities that fall under the heading “narrow” artificial intelligence. Can machines capable of autonomous reasoning—so-called general AI—be far behind? And at that point, what’s to keep them from improving themselves until they have no need for humanity?
The prospect has unleashed a wave of anxiety. “I think the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,” astrophysicist 



      Stephen Hawking



       told the BBC. Tesla founder 



      Elon Musk



       called AI “our biggest existential threat.” Former Microsoft Chief Executive 



      Bill Gates



       has voiced his agreement.
How realistic are such concerns? And how urgent? We assembled a panel of experts from industry, research and policy-making to consider the dangers—if any—that lie ahead. Taking part in the discussion are 



      Jaan Tallinn, 



       a co-founder of Skype and the think tanks Centre for the Study of Existential Risk and the Future of Life Institute; 



      Guruduth S. Banavar, 



       vice president of cognitive computing at IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center; and 



      Francesca Rossi, 



       a professor of computer science at the University of Padua, a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University and president of the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence, the main international gathering of researchers in AI.
Here are edited excerpts from their conversation.



Fueled by science-fiction novels and movies, popular treatment of this topic far too often has created a false sense of conflict between humans and machines. “Intelligent machines” tend to be great at tasks that humans are not so good at, such as sifting through vast data. Conversely, machines are pretty bad at things that humans are excellent at, such as common-sense reasoning, asking brilliant questions and thinking out of the box. The combination of human and machine, which we consider the foundation of cognitive computing, is truly revolutionizing how we solve complex problems in every field.
AI-based systems are already making our lives better in so many ways: Consider automated stock-trading agents, aircraft autopilots, recommendation systems, industrial robots, fraud detectors and search engines. In the last five to 10 years, machine-learning algorithms and advanced computational infrastructure have enabled us to build many new applications.
However, it’s important to realize that those algorithms can only go so far. More complex symbolic systems are needed to achieve major progress—and that’s a tall order. Today’s neuroscience and cognitive science barely scratch the surface of human intelligence.
My personal view is that the sensationalism and speculation around general-purpose, human-level machine intelligence is little more than good entertainment.

Today’s AI is unlikely to pose a threat. Once we shift to discussing long-term effects of general AI (which, for practical purposes, we might define as AI that’s able to do strategy, science and AI development better than humans), we run into the superintelligence control problem.



Even fully autonomous robots these days have off switches that allow humans to have ultimate control. However, the off switch only works because it is outside the domain of the robot. For instance, a chess computer is specific to the domain of chess rules, so it is unaware that its opponent can pull the plug to abort the game.
However, if we consider superintelligent machines that can represent the state of the world in general and make predictions about the consequences of someone hitting their off switch, it might become very hard for humans to use that switch if the machine is programmed (either explicitly or implicitly) to prevent that from happening.



It’s a purely theoretical problem at this stage. But it would be prudent to assume that a superintelligent AI would be constrained only by the laws of physics and the initial programming given to its early ancestor.
The initial programming is likely to be a function of our knowledge of physics—and we know that’s still incomplete! Should we find ourselves in a position where we need to specify to an AI, in program code, “Go on from here and build a great future for us,” we’d better be very certain we know how reality works.
As to your question, it could be a serious problem. It is important to retain some control over the positions of atoms in our universe [and not inadvertently give control over them to an AI].

AI is already more “intelligent” than humans in narrow domains, some of which involve delicate decision making. Humanity is not threatened by them, but many people could be affected by their decisions. Examples are autonomous online trading agents, health-diagnosis support systems and soon autonomous cars and weapons.
We need to assess their potential dangers in the narrow domains where they will function and make them safe, friendly and aligned with human values. This is not an easy task, since even humans are not rationally following their principles most of the time.



Consider automated trading systems. A bad decision in these systems may be (and has been) a financial disaster for many people. That will also be the case for self-driving cars. Some of their decisions will be critical and possibly affect lives.



Any discussion of risk has two sides: the risk of doing it and the risk of not doing it. We already know the practical risk today of decisions made with incomplete information by imperfect professionals—thousands of lives, billions of dollars and slow progress in critical fields like health care. Based on IBM’s experience with implementing Watson in multiple industries, I maintain that narrow-domain AI significantly mitigates these risks.
I will not venture into the domain of general AI, since it is anybody’s speculation. My personal opinion is that we repeatedly underestimate the complexity of implementing it. There simply are too many unknown unknowns.



Cognitive systems, like other modern computing systems, are built using cloud-computing infrastructure, algorithmic code and huge amounts of data. The behavior of these systems can be logged, tracked and audited for violations of policy. These cognitive systems are not autonomous, so their code, data and infrastructure themselves need to be protected against attacks. People who access and update any of these components can be controlled.
The data can be protected through strong encryption and its integrity managed through digital signatures. The algorithmic code can be protected using vulnerability scanning and other verification techniques. The infrastructure can be protected through isolation, intrusion protection and so on.
These mechanisms are meant to support AI safety policies that emerge from a deeper analysis of the perceived risks. Such policies need to be identified by bodies like the SEC, FDA and more broadly NIST, which generally implement standards for safety and security in their respective domains.



Watson doesn’t provide diagnoses. It digests huge amounts of medical data to provide insights and options to doctors in the context of specific cases. A doctor could consider those insights, as well as other factors, when evaluating treatment options. And the doctor can dig into the evidence supporting each of the options. But, ultimately, the doctor makes the final diagnostic decision.

Doctors make mistakes all the time, not because they are bad, but because they can’t possibly know everything there is to know about a disease. Systems like Watson will help them make fewer mistakes.

I’ve heard about research into how doctors compare to automated statistical systems when it comes to diagnosis. The conclusion was that the doctors, at least on average, were worse. What’s more, when doctors second-guessed the system, they made the result worse.

On the whole, I believe it is beneficial to have more complete information from Watson. I, for one, would personally prefer that anytime as a patient!



Technology has always had the tendency to make jobs obsolete. I’m reminded of an Uber driver whose services I used a while ago. His seat was surrounded by numerous gadgets, and he demonstrated enthusiastically how he could dictate my destination address to a tablet and receive driving instructions. I pointed out to him that, in a few years, maybe the gadgets themselves would do the driving. To which he gleefully replied that then he could sit back and relax—leaving me to quietly shake my head in the back seat. I do believe the main effect of self-driving cars will come not from their convenience but from the massive impact they will have on the job market.
In the long run, we should think about how to organize society around something other than near-universal employment.

From time immemorial, we have built tools to help us do things we can’t do. Each generation of tools has made us rethink the nature and types of jobs. Productivity goes up, professions are redefined, new professions are created and some professions become obsolete. Cognitive systems, which can enhance and scale the capabilities of our minds, have the potential to be even more transformative.
The key question will be how to build institutions to quickly train professionals to exploit cognitive systems as their assistants. Once learned, these skills will make every individual a better professional, and this will set a new bar for the nature of expertise.



There is significant uncertainty about the time horizons and whether a general AI is possible at all. (Though, being a physicist, I don’t see anything in physics that would prevent it!) Crucially, though, the uncertainty does not excuse us from thinking about the control problem. Proper research into this is just getting started and might take decades, because the problem appears very hard.

I believe we can design narrowly intelligent AI machines in a way that most undesired effects are eliminated. We need to align their values with ours and equip them with guiding principles and priorities, as well as conflict-resolution abilities that match ours. If we do that in narrowly intelligent machines, they will be the building blocks of general AI systems that will be safe enough to not threaten humanity.

In the early 1990s, when it became apparent the health-care industry would be computerized, patient-rights activists in multiple countries began a process that resulted in confidentiality regulations a decade later. In the U.S. as in other places, it is now technologically feasible to track HIPAA compliance, and it is possible to enforce the liability regulations for violations. Similarly, the serious question to ask in the context of narrow-domain AI is, what are the rights that could be violated, and what are the resulting liabilities?

As we have safety checks that need to be passed by anybody who wants to sell a human-driven car, there will need to be new checks to be passed by self-driving cars. Not only will the code running in such cars need to be carefully verified and validated, but we will also need to check that the decisions will be made according to ethical and moral principles that we would agree on.

What are the rights of drivers, passengers, and passersby in a world with self-driving cars? Is it a consumer’s right to limit the amount of information that can be exchanged between a financial adviser and her cognitive assistant? Who is liable for the advice—the financial adviser, the financial-services organization, the builder of the cognitive assistant or the curator of the data? These are as much questions about today’s world, [about how we regulate] autonomous individuals and groups with independent goals, as they are about a future world with machine intelligence.

  Tesla Loss Widens as Spending Jumps

    Luxury electric-car maker posts $154 million loss even as quarterly shipments top 10,000 cars

was stung by rising costs in its first quarter, reporting a wider net loss compared with a year ago even as the sale of regulatory credits and Model S sedans increased sharply.
The Palo Alto, Calif., luxury electric car maker said on Wednesday its loss widened to $154 million, compared with $49.8 million in the same period a year ago. Revenue climbed 51% over a year earlier to $939 million in part as deliveries of its $75,000-and-up Model S rose 55% to a record 10,045 vehicles.
Its adjusted operating loss of 36 cents a share was better than analyst forecasts of 50-cents a share operating loss. The company said it met its automotive gross operating margin target despite currency exchange challenges and greater research, development, operations and capital expenditures.
Its shares rose 2.3% in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $235.75. It released first quarter results after the 4 p.m. halt of regular trading.
The results underscore the challenge facing one of the auto industry’s most scrutinized companies. Tesla is posting record volume and says it is on track to deliver 55,000 vehicles this year, but investments in its network of fast-charging stations, and the development of its forthcoming Model X sport-utility vehicle and other future products widened losses and reduced its liquidity.
Its cash and equivalents fell to $1.5 billion on March 31, from $1.9 billion three months earlier and $2.4 billion a year ago. Chief Executive Officer 



      Elon Musk



       has said the company can fund its growth plan without share sales or convertible bond offerings.
The company said it remains on track to start delivering its vital Model X late in the third quarter and that it expects to begin making battery cells and full battery packs at a new Nevada factory in late 2016—earlier than previously forecast.
The company’s battery-making plans have been in focus following Mr. Musk’s April 30 launch of a new stationary-storage business. The investment in battery-making capabilities is one of the company’s large capital expense items.
Mr. Musk said on Wednesday that the response to its storage products has been “crazy, off the hook” and production of the home power storage gear is sold out through the middle of 2016.
Tesla has been lifting its results by selling regulatory credits. It sold $66 million such credits in the first quarter, up sharply compared with the same period a year ago; it said it expects to sell $15 million more in the current quarter.
The auto maker, like others selling zero-emission cars, has regulatory credits that can be transferred to rivals needing to improve their emissions scores. Excluding those credits, the company said the gross margin on its Model S sedan was on plan at 26% of revenue on an adjusted basis and 25% on a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles basis. Analysts closely watch gross margin because it shows the company’s efficiency as it reaches higher levels of production and scale.
Tesla said it expects to produce 12,500 vehicles in the current quarter, and deliver between 10,000 and 11,000 vehicles. Tesla also said it would raise the price on Model S vehicles by an average of 5% in European markets because of the strengthening U.S. dollar against the euro.
The company said it closed on a $100 million line of credit related to its leasing business in the quarter and plans to close on additional financing in the coming months.
Tesla’s share price plummeted to below $190 earlier this year after fourth-quarter volumes missed expectations in China. Its shares have since risen 22.3% since the end of the first quarter in part to the announcement of the new stationary power storage business.

  Will Tesla’s Newest Battery Pan Out?

    Rivals abound but key challenge will be driving down price of home battery packs

The brand name won’t be enough.
As


makes a bid to dominate the budding market for electricity storage, it faces lots of competitors and rival technologies, energy experts say. And plenty of challenges—including driving down the price of its “power walls” to a level that will prompt price-sensitive consumers to spring for them.
Tesla
that it is repackaging the lithium ion batteries it now uses in its electric cars to sell them as electricity-storage devices for homes, businesses and utilities. The battery packs are meant to absorb electricity when it is cheap and plentiful—during a sunny afternoon for a house with rooftop solar panels, for example—and release the power when electricity is expensive or scarce.
So far the market for electricity storage remains small, though growing quickly; last year about $128 million worth of such batteries were installed around the country, mostly at utilities, according to GTM Research, which tracks the renewable energy industry. Just 1% of the capacity was installed at homes.
Tesla plans to change all that. At an event to formally announce the battery products, 



      Elon Musk, 



       the company’s chief executive, said it is “trying to change the fundamental energy infrastructure of the world.” The company’s shares, which had risen by about 6% in the days before the party, ended Friday almost unchanged at $225.96, down nine cents.
A few companies, including Sungevity and Sunrun Inc., plan to offer battery systems for consumers who have solar panels, at prices they say will be competitive with Tesla’s. For bigger users, companies including Sunverge Energy Inc., Stem Inc. and Green Charge Networks offer lithium-ion batteries made by companies like
and

with various financing options. Another group of companies sells what are known as flow batteries, which are more common for very large users like utilities.
“So many companies are fighting over a market that’s practically nonexistent right now,” said 



      Haresh Kamath, 



       energy storage expert at the Electric Power Research Center in Palo Alto, Calif. “Tesla is betting they can produce a charismatic product that consumers will want to buy—like what Apple did with the iPhone.”
Tesla will have to sell eight home battery systems to equal the size of each battery pack going into one of its luxury cars, he said.
Environmentally conscious consumers—think:
Leaf drivers—are likely to opt for these types of home batteries, said 



      Venkat Srinivasan, 



       head of the battery program at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. But battery prices need to drop by about 75% before they go mainstream, he said. “The big catch will be decreasing the costs.”
Tesla says it has an answer for that, too: the giant battery factory it is building in Reno, Nev., with

, which makes the batteries it uses in its cars. Tesla says the new plant can cut 30% off the cost of producing batteries.
For consumers, Tesla is offering a 7 kilowatt-hour system for $3,000 and a 10 kilowatt-hour battery pack for $3,500. Since the average house creates an electrical load of 2 to 5 kilowatts, the packs could power an entire house for a couple of hours. Or they could run essential household circuits—a refrigerator, microwave, lights and fans—throughout the evening when solar panels don’t produce, provided there was enough sun during the day to charge up the batteries.
The devices, which feature a 10-year warranty, would be bolted to a wall near an electrical panel. Special controllers would toggle between batteries and solar panels, deciding when to put power on the grid or pump it into batteries. These same smart controls would also decide when to release power from the batteries.
Batteries are only a small piece of the total cost of a solar/storage system. An integrated system includes solar panels, batteries and inverter, smart controls, building permits, labor and other costs that can add up to $20,000 or more.
Tesla’s prices for installing batteries and other equipment are on the low end of the energy storage market’s current range of $800 to $2,000 a kilowatt-hour, said GTM Research analyst 



      Ravi Manghani.



       Those installation prices need to drop by half or more, to less than $500 a kilowatt-hour to attract a lot of demand, he predicted.
But there are other, less cost-conscious customers for energy storage. Businesses, which pay extra charges based on their peak demand for power, are already starting to use the equipment to cut their energy use and utility bills.
Utilities themselves are also interested in bigger battery systems to help them even out the fluctuating flows of electricity from solar farms or wind turbines, keeping the grid stable or eliminating the need for expensive grid upgrades.
Utilities think energy storage will become an essential part of the electric system in coming years because so much renewable energy is being added to the grid, said 



      Mark Rawson, 



       head of technology for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District in California.
Lithium ion technology, which Tesla uses, looks good today because it can absorb and release electricity relatively quickly and can go through many charge and discharge cycles without failing, he said. “But I wouldn’t say it’s a silver bullet. There’s still lots of innovation happening.”

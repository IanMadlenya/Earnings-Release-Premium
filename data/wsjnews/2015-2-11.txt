  Tough Love

    The spectacular downfall of Oregon’s governor.

Hey, Kitz! What time is it? “Senate President Peter Courtney and House Speaker Tina Kotek met with Gov. John Kitzhaber on Thursday morning and told him it was time to resign,” the
reports. Only a day late, he yielded and
he will quit.
Yes, it’s another spectacular Beaver State political downfall. First there was Bob Packwood, who resigned from the U.S. Senate in 1995 so as to dodge expulsion after it emerged that he’d spent much of his nearly 27-year tenure engaged in what by the end had become known as sexual harassment and defined as a tortious act. Earlier this week, as
notes, Packwood, 82, was back in the Senate, this time as an expert witness on tax reform.
Then there was David Wu, a seven-term representative from Portland who resigned in 2011 over allegations that he’d had what was described as an “unwanted sexual encounter” with an 18-year-old woman. More bizarre if not exactly scandalous, Wu emailed staffers photos of himself “in a plush tiger suit with orange- and black-striped mittens over his hands, a hood with pointy ears pulled over his head and a white circle split by a zipper stretched over his stomach,” in the words of the
.

reported last July that Wu still routinely “strolls onto the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives,” a privilege Congress grants to former members. “He’s in a suit,” BuzzFeed noted, “as any lawmaker would be.” The accompanying photo shows no evident stripes, and certainly no orange ones.
Gov. Kitzhaber’s scandal involves not sex but nepotism—albeit constructively, as the other involved party is not related to him, merely betrothed. That would be the unconventionally spelled Cylvia Hayes, an “energy consultant” who as his longtime girlfriend has assumed the ceremonial role of first lady although she is not (yet) Mrs. Kitzhaber.
“No one who knew John in the old days would be surprised that he was brought down by a woman,” writes
, who knew Kitzhaber when the future governor was an upperclassman at Dartmouth some 4½ decades ago. “John loved women, and women loved John. Which, of course, is why we freshmen admired him so much.”
In an editorial last week urging Kitzhaber’s resignation, the
went through the bill of particulars (and linked to a
with more detail):
Captain Renault couldn’t have put it better.
Hayes also provided an October surprise when she “confessed to breaking federal law in 1997 by entering into an illegal marriage with an 18-year-old Ethiopian immigrant,” the
reported a few weeks before last year’s election. “She was paid approximately $5,000 to marry the man, Abraham B. Abraham,” a sham marriage for naturalization purposes. “She claims Kitzhaber did not know until this week, when WW first raised questions about it.”
That wasn’t enough to sink the Democratic governor’s re-election in a state that last elected a Republican governor in 1982. Kitzhaber has the unique distinction of having been elected despite all three recent Republican midterm waves—in 1994, 2010 and 2014. (He also won re-election in 1998, but left office in 2003 because Oregon’s Constitution limits governors to two consecutive terms.)
This week, however, the pressure mounted for Kitzhaber to quit. The
sums up the action on its useful live-update page: “Kitzhaber decided to resign Tuesday but then changed his mind, insisting Wednesday afternoon that he’s staying.” The Willamette Week and the amusingly named KINK-FM reported that Kitzhaber’s staff “sought to destroy thousands of his emails from the governor’s personal email accounts”—emails the Oregonian had been trying to obtain.
In addition to the legislative leaders, Ted Wheeler, the state treasurer, called for the governor’s resignation. Perhaps most damaging was a statement from
, the secretary of state and now the governor-designate (Oregon has no lieutenant governor).
Brown reported that Kitzhaber summoned her back from Washington, D.C., Tuesday “to speak with him in person and alone.” When she arrived, “he asked me why I came back early from Washington.” Then he “told me he was not resigning, after which, he began a discussion about transition.”
She summed up the matter with understatement: “This is clearly a bizarre and unprecedented situation.” Kitzhaber’s resignation is effective Wednesday, but perhaps he’ll follow the Wu example and hang around Salem for years to come.


Jon Stewart this week announced his retirement from what’s supposed to be a comedy show, and journalists engaged in a strange round of mourning as if they were losing one of their own. CNN’s Christiane Amanpour tweeted: “We’re really going to miss Jon Stewart’s authority…no joke :(“
Ricochet’s
notes some Twitter reactions. CNN’s Brian Stetler: “Jon Stewart has been, among many other things, one of the finest media critics of this era.” The New York Times’s Patricia Cohen: “Jon Stewart has done more to engage next generation in the news than any other single person.”
The Times’s
disagrees with Cohen: “When Stewart leaves later this year, he will walk away from an audience that will no longer take the theater of media-driven politics seriously.” But he means that as a eulogy, too. He continues: “He’s been a public service—Consumer Reports, by way of the long-dead National Lampoon. And for many in the press, he says what they’ve always wanted to say, using an unprintable word as noun, verb and adjective.”
Perhaps that last assertion explains why liberal journalists admire Stewart so much: He says what they believe but cannot say because they are obliged to maintain an air of objectivity, or at least fairness. Also, he frequently targeted Fox News Channel, an ideologically mold-breaking journalistic enterprise:
“Critics would say Stewart is a liberal apologist, a sop [sic] for President Obama,” Egan also asserts. “But his politics are beside the point. Conservatives, in general, are not funny. . . . The best comedians do not back the status quo, or get paid to make the Koch brothers laugh.”
How can Stewart be both a challenger of “the status quo” and a defender not only of the country’s most powerful politician but of a media establishment desperate to retain its ability to impose “a common narrative” on society?
Commentary’s
resolves the paradox:
A unified theory of Jon Stewart begins with the realization that “the status quo” and “reality” are synonyms—both meaning, roughly, the way things are. Which makes the nonfake liberal journalists even harder to understand. If you dislike reality so much, why would you choose a profession requiring constant exposure to it?

  Tesla’s Loss Widens as Deliveries Fall Short 

    Electric-Car Maker Says Demand Remains Strong for Model S Sedans

Elon Musk



       said all is well with


and predicted brighter days in 2015, even as the company reported that its fourth-quarter loss widened to $108 million, missing analysts’ forecasts, as deliveries of its $71,000-and-up luxury electric cars fell short of an already lowered forecast because of weather and customers unable to accept deliveries.
The car maker, based in Palo Alto, Calif., posted a loss of 13 cents a share, below analysts’ consensus expectations for a 31-cent-a-share profit, both adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and other costs.
Tesla said Wednesday that while demand remained strong for its Model S sedan, shipment problems affected deliveries and the strong dollar also hurt results. The company had 10,000 orders booked for cars and 20,000 orders for a coming sport-utility vehicle called the Model X.
Tesla said it expects global sales of 55,000 vehicles in 2015.
Speaking to investors after release of the results on Wednesday, Mr. Musk, the company’s chief executive, said “our financials are better than they appear, not worse.” He mused that the company’s market cap in 10 years could approach that of

if its growth stayed on track and that he could plow a “staggering amount of money” into capital spending without raising much from capital markets.
Tesla said it was unable to deliver about 1,400 vehicles that were produced in December, reducing its revenue and profit. It cited heavy demand for the newly released all-wheel-drive version of its Model S.
Tesla sold 9,834 vehicles in the fourth quarter, up from 6,892 a year earlier and 7,785 in the third quarter. For the year, Tesla delivered 32,733 vehicles, just shy of its lowered volume projection of 33,000. Revenue in the fourth quarter jumped to $956.6 million from $615 million a year earlier. The year-earlier net loss was $16 million, or 13 cents a share.
Operating expenses nearly doubled from a year earlier to $336.5 million in the quarter. Its cash fell to $1.9 billion in the quarter, down from $2.4 billion at the end of the third quarter.
Shares of Tesla plunged 6% to $199.22 in early trading on Thursday after closing off $3.49 at $212.80 on Wednesday, before its results were released.
Analysts at


and
pointed to problems that went beyond the weather and vacation periods that the company blamed on lower-than-expected deliveries and profits in the fourth quarter. Tesla’s revenue included $55 million in sales of pollution tax credits to other auto makers.
Mr. Musk startled investors in January when he said the company likely wouldn’t achieve a net profit until 2020, when the company’s coming Model 3 sedan would be in full production. At the same Detroit conference, he estimated that Tesla could be selling more than a million cars a year by 2025.
On Wednesday, Mr. Musk tried to reassure investors that free cash flow would be significant by 2020, even if the company wasn’t making net profits.
Tesla said its 2015 capital spending is expected to be about $1.5 billion as it expands production capacity, completes Model X development and invests in an advanced battery factory, showrooms and service centers. The company said it is on track to start producing some batteries at its so-called Gigafactory near Reno, Nev., in 2016.
Over the past 12 months, Tesla’s stock has bounced around, hitting $291.42 in September and falling as low as $177.22 in January, following his comments about China and future profits.
Since Tesla last reported its results, Mr. Musk has declared that sales in China have slowed significantly, blaming poor communications about the availability of charging infrastructure. The company’s top China executive left Tesla in December after a one-year tenure.
Mr. Musk said the concern about a drop in China sales was “overblown” and that the lack of demand was “irrelevant,” because there weren’t enough cars available in other markets.
Analysts have been lowering their expectations for the stock price and delivery forecasts. 



      Brian Johnson, 



       a Barclays auto analyst, said in a note that its fourth quarter results were “heavily supported” by emission credits the company sells to other auto makers. Tesla’s attempt to “cross the chasm,” a term from 



      Geoffrey Moore’s



       book on technology companies making it to the mainstream, appears to be harder than originally thought, he wrote.
In addition to tepid demand in China, which Tesla has forecast to account for a third of its sales, low gasoline prices might be taking steam out of demand. Delays developing its Model X SUV, which won’t be delivered to customers until the third quarter, mean it will take longer to hit sales goals than expected. For the year, Asia as a whole supplied 15% of Tesla’s sales. Europe accounted for 30%.

  Apple Gears Up to Challenge Tesla in Electric Cars

    IPhone Maker Has 100s Working on Design of a Minivan Like Vehicle

has revolutionized music and phones. Now it is aiming at a much bigger target: automobiles.
The Cupertino, Calif., company has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter. The project, code-named “Titan,” initially is working on the design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan, one of the people said.
An Apple spokesman declined to comment.
Apple ultimately could decide not to proceed with a car. In addition, many technologies used in an electric car, such as advanced batteries and in-car electronics, could be useful to other Apple products, including the iPhone and iPad.
Apple often investigates technologies and potential products, going as far as building multiple prototypes for some things that it won’t ever sell. Any car would take several years to complete and obtain safety certifications.


But the size of the project team and the senior people involved indicate that the company is serious, these people said. Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars including the
Steyr unit of Canadian auto supplier

A Magna spokeswoman declined to comment.
Apple’s industrial design team is staffed with several people who have experience at European auto makers. Last year, Apple hired 



      Marc Newson, 



       a famous industrial designer and close friend of the company’s design guru, 



      Jony Ive.



       In the past, Mr. Newson created a concept car for


Apple hopes to put its stamp on the electric vehicle market in the same way it did the smartphone with its iPhone, said a person familiar with its work. Even though Apple defied expectations of slowing growth with a 30% rise in revenue in the quarter ended December, the company is under constant scrutiny of where its next breakthrough product will come from.
Earlier this week, Mr. Cook said at an investor conference that he does not believe that companies naturally start to slow as their revenue grows. He said this was “dogma” and that Apple didn’t believe in putting limits on what it was capable of.
A side benefit of the project, according to one of the people, is that it has persuaded many Apple employees who were thinking of leaving the company to stay and work on an exciting new endeavor without the pressure of churning new products every year.
Other Silicon Valley giants are looking at autos. Google Inc. has been working on a self-driving car for years. The head of Google’s autonomous vehicle project said last year that the company aims to forge a partnership with auto makers to build a self-driving car within the next few years. A self-driving car is not part of Apple’s current plan, one of the people familiar with the project said.
“There are products that we’re working on that no one knows about,” Chief Executive 



      Tim Cook



       told interviewer 



      Charlie Rose



       in September. “That haven’t been rumored about yet.”
Building cars is capital intensive, costing hundreds of millions of dollars for design, tools and production and certifications. Auto makers also must help ramp up a supply network for the thousands of components that go into a vehicle.
Battery-powered cars add another dimension.


for instance, has seen losses widen amid rising expenses to build an electric sport-utility vehicle. It expects to spend $1.5 billion on capital expenditures and R&D this year.
Mr. Cook approved the car project almost a year ago and assigned veteran product design Vice President 



      Steve Zadesky



       to lead the group, the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Zadesky is a former Ford engineer who helped lead the Apple teams that created the iPod and iPhone.
Mr. Zadesky was given permission to create a 1,000-person team and poach employees from different parts of the company, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Working from a private location a few miles from Apple’s corporate headquarters in Cupertino, the team is researching different types of robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing, the people said.
In September, Apple hired 



      Johann Jungwirth, 



       who had been the president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, which has operations in Sunnyvale, Calif., near Apple’s campus, according to his LinkedIn profile.
The Financial Times reported earlier that dozens of Apple employees are researching automotive products, citing people familiar with the company.
Over the past 15 years, Apple has built a track record of upending industries. Its iPod music players and iTunes service accelerated the shift to digital music. The iPhone established the smartphone market and changed the notion of mobile computing. Apple plans to introduce its Apple Watch in April, which the company hopes will create a market for wearable devices.
Manufacturing a car is enormously expensive. A single plant usually costs well over $1 billion and requires a massive supply chain to produce the more than 10,000 components in a car. 



      Elon Musk, 



       chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla, complained last fall that it is “really hard” to make a car amid the company’s struggle to ramp up production of its Model S sedan.
The expense is a barrier to entry to many potential competitors, but would be less of a hurdle for Apple, which reported holding $178 billion in cash as of Dec. 27, 2014.
Tesla was able to ramp up its manufacturing quickly and relatively cheaply by buying a former

factory in Fremont, Calif., for $42 million in 2010. Tesla has since invested hundreds of millions of dollars to tool up the factory and still only produced 35,000 vehicles in 2014.
Auto makers tend to operate their own factories. For years, Apple has relied on contract manufacturers to build its products. That has helped Apple keep a lean supply chain and reduce inventory exposure.
Apple has been working with auto makers on bringing its software expertise into the car. More than two dozen auto makers plan to use its CarPlay service, which allows a driver to access Apple services like iTunes music, maps and Siri through the vehicle’s dashboard information system.

  Fire Up Your Batteries

    In 1905, a magazine called Horseless Age warned that the fuel supply was limited and ‘farseeing men’ should look for alternatives.

That the motoring world might want to rethink its reliance on fossil fuels is hardly a new idea. “One of the great problems of the near future,” warned 



      Thomas J. Fay, 



       perhaps best remembered as the president of the Society of Automotive Engineers, “ . . . will be that of an adequate and suitable fuel supply. The available supply of gasoline, as is well known, is quite limited, and it behooves the farseeing men of the motor car industry to look for likely substitutes.”
Mr. Fay offered that advice, in a magazine called Horseless Age, in 1905—when the embryonic U.S. auto industry consisted of 121 small car makers in 17 states, Cleveland vied with Detroit as Motor City, and 



      Henry Ford’s



       Model T was still three years off. At that time, despite viable alternatives—steam, electricity and trial engines that burned everything from denatured alcohol to corn liquor—86.2% of the nation’s new cars were powered by gasoline. More than a century later, Fay (or his great-grandchildren) could voice the same worry without changing a word. Only now his audience would be all ears: Fretful about dwindling oil reserves and the gas engine’s collateral damage, auto makers and their customers are clamoring for the very sort of clean, efficient powertrains that their great-grandfathers abandoned.
To explain the scramble for the next-generation auto—and the roles played in that race by governments, auto makers, venture capitalists, environmentalists and private inventors—comes Levi Tillemann’s “The Great Race: The Global Quest for the Car of the Future.” “Today’s race is fundamentally different from what came before,” Mr. Tillemann writes in the book’s introduction, “in that it marks a decisive shift away from Henry Ford’s oil-fueled internal combustion engine to something else. The overwhelming odds are that the car of the future will drive on electricity in some form or another, and eventually it will be less car than robot. In other words, it will drive itself.”
By Levi Tillemann


The air of skunk works discovery, of tinkering genius, hangs thick over these opening pages, and Mr. Tillemann seems ideally cast to guide us through the big ideas percolating in the world’s far-flung workshops and labs. He is an inventor himself: With his father and brothers, he conceived a gasoline engine, the IRIS, that is smaller and theoretically more efficient than standard designs of the same output, and over the past decade the design has won attaboys from NASA and ConocoPhillips. He has pitched the engine in Detroit’s corporate suites. He speaks Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese and Japanese.
His book seems right on time, too, for at no point has the industry been in such flux, with its leaders willing to reconsider the assumptions that have steered it for generations. How we got to this point is itself a monumental subject, filled with heroes and heartbreak, damn-the-world courage and expensive miscues. Mr. Tillemann divides the tale into three parts, the first charting how California’s ratcheting environmental regulations sparked a world-wide drive for emissions controls and better gas mileage in the 1990s. We look on as Honda engineers refine the company’s engines until some “were running so clean that the air coming out of the tailpipe was
than the ambient levels in the lab and natural environment.” We meet 



      Takeshi Uchiyamada, 



       who led Toyota’s development of the Prius and launched a global craze for hybrids. We witness GM’s flirtation with electric cars—signaled when then-CEO 



      Roger Smith



       tooled around in a two-seater in 1990.
Mr. Tillemann’s second section details Japanese car makers’ scramble to develop electrics in the late 1990s and early oughts; America’s efforts to keep up (or, in the case of Tesla’s 



      Elon Musk, 



       show the way); and China’s all-thumbs bid to leapfrog the competition with an electric fleet of its own. The last section, a bit softer in its focus, relates how the Great Recession and other recent disasters weeded out the dilettantes.
All of this should make for lively reading. Alas, it does not, in part because Mr. Tillemann’s writing bleeds the drama from his story: Characters worth our attention go unfleshed; action reads as if it has been observed from a great height. Mr. Tillemann evidently traveled the world and conducted a great many interviews for his story, but the fruits of his personal observation are largely invisible; the reader never has the sense of being in the middle of, and witness to, the events he describes.
Instead, the whole business feels a lot like a textbook—an impression bolstered early on by a subchapter headed “Organization of Contents” and cemented by Mr. Tillemann’s phrasing, which veers here and there into academese and is studded throughout with mechanical tics. Stronger editing might have eliminated such inelegance, but it would take a complete overhaul to provide this narrative the speed and thrills that its subject deserves.
Almost as vexing, “The Great Race” fails to deliver on the promises of its subtitle, let alone of the introduction, because it is less about the car of the future than about the car of the past few years—a history of how today’s electric cars and gas-sipping hybrids came to be. Only in a 19-page afterword does Mr. Tillemann turn his attention to the days and cars to come, and here he relies on vague prognostication rather than sharp analysis or storytelling. His passages on autonomous cars—which he says are a sure thing—are reminiscent of 1950s magazine pieces about the nuclear sedans we would soon be driving.
Readers of “The Great Race” may be smarter for having taken the ride, but most won’t have much fun along the way. Even Mr. Fay, unabashed in his curiosity about the horseless carriage, would probably find that it feels too much like work.

  The Tesla Paradox

    Visions of a $700 billion market cap but still living off subsidies.

Elon Musk



       isn’t known for modesty, and this week the
CEO laid out his ambition to grow 50% a year and deliver a stock valuation in 10 years of $700 billion—the current valuation of Apple, the world’s most valuable company. So why does Tesla, which is already valued at about $27 billion, still need so much taxpayer welfare?
Mr. Musk this week played down a $108 million loss in Tesla’s fiscal fourth quarter, which he attributed to one-time manufacturing inefficiencies, a strong dollar and lower than expected deliveries. Tesla said delivering some “cars was physically impossible due to a combination of customers being on vacation, severe winter weather and shipping problems (with actual ships).” Tesla shares fell 4.66% Thursday on the news.
The world loves an optimist, and fast-growing start-ups often lose money as they focus on capital investment. What makes Tesla different is that the bottom line would have been much worse without $86 million in profits from the sale of government emissions credits. A
analyst told the Journal that the fourth-quarter results were “heavily supported” by the credits.
Because it produces only electric cars, Tesla receives excess “credits” for complying with federal fuel-efficiency standards and state zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates, notably in California. Tesla can then hawk its surplus credits to auto makers that fail to meet the government rules. Last year Tesla made a roughly $150 million killing from selling ZEV credits. That’s up from $130 million in 2013, $32 million in 2012, and $3 million in 2011. All told in 2014 Tesla sold about $216 million in credits, equal to about 7% of its auto sales.
Those government subsidies come on top of a $7,500 federal tax credit for each electric car sale and state rebates. Nevada and California have also bestowed upward of $1.5 billion in tax breaks on Tesla.
A Tesla earnings report last year predicted that revenue from credits would “remain low in the future relative to our automotive sales” though it would “pursue opportunities to monetize ZEV credits.” Such opportunities will abound as California’s ZEV and federal fuel-efficiency mandates grow more stringent. More states are also adopting electric-car mandates.
Capitalism needs visionaries, but its reputation suffers when companies worth billions soak middle-class taxpayers for profits. Turn off the taxpayer tap, Mr. Musk. It would earn you more friends for the long haul.

  Why GM Hired 8,000 Programmers

    Car Maker brought much of its technology in-house to make custom software; selling trucks online

Alvin Kowalik



       has purchased many


pickup trucks over the years. But last year, the cattle rancher in Selma, Texas, tried something new, and purchased a pickup through GM’s Shop-Click-Drive website.
“I found the truck, listed my trade-in and was given the sales price. A nice lady from the dealership calls me, we made a deal, they drove it out and I signed the papers,” Mr. Kowalik said.
For Mr. Kowalik, 68 years old, the transaction was easy. For GM, the deal effectively took three years, involving an overhaul of its computer infrastructure, beginning with creating its own software development unit and building programs to reflect customers’ preference for online shopping and ordering.
Two years ago, Chief Information Officer 



      Randy Mott



       ended GM’s $3 billion a year outsourcing deal with

, replacing it and others with about 8,000 GM software engineers, up from 1,400 previously. “Because we brought the [information technology] work back in-house, we can take the lid off of what is possible,” Mr. Mott said in an interview.
GM is among companies ranging from

to

that are building custom software for products and internal use. They believe it is the best way to differentiate themselves and respond as rapidly as possible to customer preferences.
The new focus on custom, internally-built software poses a potential challenge to technology outsourcing companies such as H-P and Dell Inc., as well as providers of off-the-shelf business software, such as

, Oracle Corp. and

While they still play a role even in custom projects such as Shop-Click-Drive, the role may be smaller than it otherwise might have been.
It is still too early to say whether GM’s investments in IT have had a discernible impact on the bottom line. But the technology has led to significant changes in the way the company operates and goes to market, and it has helped open up new sales sources of revenue such as capturing online shoppers.
Changes to the business were just as complex as the technology. “Shopping for cars online has been the Holy Grail for decades. It’s difficult,” said 



      Ryndee Carney, 



       a GM spokeswoman. Many consumers are interested in shopping for cars on online, but the size of the transaction can give them second thoughts about the process, Ms. Carney said. State laws also mandate that new vehicles must be sold through a dealership, not a manufacturer or a third-party. You can’t buy a new car on Amazon.
Until now, the closest that the market has come to online shopping for new vehicles has been third-party websites like

which sell leads to dealers. GM said it worked with dealers to give them an alternative. Unlike the third-party sites, Shop-Click-Drive resides on the dealer’s Internet platform, and it is free for them to use. The close rate for Shop-Click-Drive is higher too—30%, compared with at best 22% at third party sites, according to Ms. Carney. So far, about 1,800 of GM’s 4,300 dealers have agreed to participate in the program, she said. She declined to discuss how the program’s margins compare to those of traditional sales channels. In its first year of operation, Shop-Click-Drive helped sell about 15,000 new vehicles.
The creation of the technology platform wasn’t a sure thing, either. The Shop-Click-Drive platform was a two-year, built-from-scratch endeavor designed to link potential shoppers with dealers who had the vehicles they wanted. The auto maker hired software developer, Entrega Systems Group Inc., in Troy, Mich., to develop a small pilot for the program. GM said its internal teams, including software engineers, testers and business analysts, worked on areas such as the “back end” of the platform—the behind the scenes stuff that customers don’t see—and the software tool that connects dealers to GM. The custom applications are integrated into commercial components such as an Oracle database, GM said.

‘There is no way a dealer could do something like this on his own.’

Shop-Click-Drive operates like an electronic bridge. A customer who clicks on the site is automatically routed to a dealership website. The electronic exchange takes place on GM’s servers in Warren, Mich. Dealers electronically send their inventory data to GM daily. However, none of the information collected from a customer is kept by GM.
“We pass the customer information, such as names and address onto the dealer and the financial information, such as credit applications, onto our partner RouteOne which secures the customer data on its severs in Farmington Hills, Mich., before passing it to the banks,” selected by a dealer, said 



      Jim Bement, 



       manager of Shop-Click-Drive. “Once that is done, the information is automatically erased” from GM servers.
The move protects GM since the auto maker doesn’t sell vehicles directly to customers as per its agreement with its dealership network. The site also is programmed to work with information providers such as Kelley Blue Book, which offers trade-in value data.
“There is no way a dealer could do something like this on his own,” said Mr. Bement. “They don’t have that type of money and they don’t have access to all the technology we have at the headquarters.”
Mr. Mott says the auto maker is in the early stages of leveraging its new computer and software capability. But he doubts that Shop-Click-Drive could have been built without those investments. “Engineers…were constrained on the computing they could use and the applications we could run,” he says.

  U.S. Stocks Rise, Nearing Record Highs

    Ukraine Truce Deal, Corporate Earnings Boost Sentiment

U.S. stocks climbed, with major benchmarks nearing record highs, buoyed by a truce deal in Ukraine and strong quarterly earnings reports.
The S&P 500 index gained 19.95 points, or 1%, to 2088.48, putting it within striking distance of its record close of 2090.57 reached in late December.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 110.24 points, or 0.6%, to 17972.38—about 0.5% short of its 18053.71 record finish.
The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 56.43 points, or 1.2%, to 4857.61, its highest closing level since March 2000.
Stocks rallied at the open, riding on the heels of gains in Europe after
. Germany’s DAX index finished at its 11th record close of the year after rising 1.6%, while the Stoxx Europe 600 index added 0.75%. Meanwhile, eurozone finance ministers vowed to continue negotiations after six-hour talks failed to find a way to resolve Greece’s financial issues.
The news helped ease concerns over the political and economic fortunes of Europe, which have buffeted stocks in recent weeks.
“The market really has changed its stripes in a positive way on its view of Europe,” said 



      Joe Spinelli, 



       who heads single-stock trading in the Americas for

“It definitely helps from a sentiment perspective that you’ve got some resolution over in Ukraine.”
Strong earnings also gave stocks a lift. Shares of Dow component Cisco Systems Inc. soared 9.4%, contributing 16 points to the blue-chip index. The company reported higher revenue and net income and boosted its dividend.
Shares of

soared 22% after the company’s fourth-quarter profit soared on stronger-than-expected revenue.

jumped 4.1% after reporting adjusted earnings that exceeded expectations.
Investors have been encouraged by a recent string of positive quarterly earnings reports. In early January, analysts had expected fourth-quarter profits to rise just 1.1% for S&P 500 companies, marking the slowest pace of earnings growth since the third quarter of 2012, according to FactSet.
But those forecasts have so far proven too dire. While contracting profits in the energy and financial sectors have curbed earnings gains overall, double-digit growth in the health-care, industrial and telecommunications sectors have cushioned the blow. About three-fourths of S&P 500 companies have reported fourth-quarter earnings, and profits are now on track to rise 3.9%, according to FactSet. A big contributor was the 38% rise in quarterly profits by

the largest company by market capitalization.
“All in all, given where we were three weeks ago, things are substantially better,” said Jeff Yu, head of single stock derivatives trading at

“The flows we’re seeing definitely are more constructive. People are buying stocks. People are reinvesting.”
Mr. Spinelli, of Deutsche Bank, said he has noticed a more bullish tilt among investor clients, encouraged in part by improving U.S. economic data. He said a number of investors have lately been shifting out of more defensive pockets of the market, such as utilities, and into riskier areas like technology stocks.
S&P 500 utilities stocks fell 0.5% on Thursday and have shed 5.5% so far in February. The S&P 500’s information technology sector, meanwhile, advanced 1.6% Thursday and 6.1% for the month.
“On an overall basis, I still think we’re in a bull market,” said Martin Sass, head of the $7.5-billion money manager M.D. Sass. “I don’t see the forces that tend to end bull markets—namely no recession on the horizon, no meaningful increase in bond yields, and little inflation. So it’s a good environment overall.”
Mr. Sass said the recent volatility has presented buying opportunities, though he has been avoiding energy stocks until oil prices find an equilibrium.
In deal news, Expedia Inc. agreed to buy Orbitz Worldwide Inc. for about $1.3 billion. Shares of Orbitz jumped 22% and those of Expedia rose 15%.
Shares of

. Shares of Costco gained 0.2%.
Shares of Tesla Motors Inc. fell 4.7% after the company said its fourth-quarter loss widened to $108 million, while deliveries of its $71,000-and-up luxury electric cars fell short of its forecast.
In economic news, jobless claims in the week ended Feb. 7 rose 25,000 to 304,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 290,000 claims. The level of claims was consistent with solid job growth.
Retail sales fell in January for the second month in a row, fueling worries that the drop in gasoline prices isn’t translating into more consumer spending. Sales fell 0.8% last month to $439.77 billion, the Commerce Department said. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected a 0.5% decline.
In commodity markets, crude-oil futures gained 4.9% to $51.21 a barrel. Gold futures added 0.1% to $1220.10 an ounce. Treasury prices rose, pushing the 10-year yield down to 1.983% from 1.987% on Wednesday.

  What Apple Is Driving At

    High Hopes Signal Company Knows It Must Move Beyond iPhone Dependence

An Apple car is a long ways off—if it ever actually arrives. Closer at hand are questions about how the company sees itself evolving.

in a project code-named Titan, according to The Wall Street Journal. This has progressed enough that Apple employees are taking meetings with contract manufacturers that specialize in high-end autos.
Apple fans may squeal at the prospect of an iCar. And Apple’s enormous financial resources—which include nearly $178 billion in cash—are often considered a ticket into any business. Questions about a foray into the automotive sector don’t revolve around Apple’s ability to foot the bill, though. They have more to do with how well Apple would take to a highly regulated industry with long design cycles, not to mention one well outside its core competency.
So it is tempting to consider such a move as a fool’s errand. And it is one that could encourage more pressure from activists who may take it as a sign Apple still doesn’t know what to do with all that cash. Some
to keep up with Silicon Valley neighbor Google, which has its own project focused on self-driving cars.
Even so, Apple is making this particular gamble from a position of strength. The iPhone 6 has been a major hit, taking market share from rivals and reviving the company’s image as an innovation powerhouse.
There is a flip side to such success, though. Namely, that around two-thirds of Apple’s revenue now comes from one product line—in an industry known for brands that can quickly flame out. And while the launch of the Apple Watch is nigh, the business potential for that device remains uncertain.
So Apple can’t afford to rest on its gold-plated laurels. Nor can it think small. Growing projected 2017 revenue by just 10% would require another $25 billion in revenue—about seven times
’ current annual sales.
Gaining just a small portion of the high-end car business could help diversify the Apple’s revenue. And even if it falls short of rolling its own car off the line—consumers have yet to see a much-discussed Apple television—the company could make significant breakthroughs in areas like batteries, software and electronics. Those could form lucrative businesses in their own right.
For investors, the destination could justify what will likely be a long ride. They just shouldn’t let iCar dreams race too far ahead of reality.

  Tesla’s Growth Is a Matter of Survival

is really in rarefied territory now.
That doesn’t refer only to its market value, which is nearly half that of


The dual-motor version of Tesla’s Model S has been clocked accelerating to 60 miles an hour at a faster pace than the legendary McLaren F1. The latter was the world’s fastest production car until a decade ago, and used ones fetch millions of dollars.
That is impressive, but it raises the question of whether Tesla the company can handle its speedy growth. In November, when reporting third-quarter results, management wrote that planned 50% unit growth in 2014 and again in 2015 is “unusual in the car industry.” No kidding.
Wednesday’s full-year results call should provide guidance on the delayed launch of the mass-market Model X, expected later this year, and financial targets. Even before hearing from management, the first two numbers investors will focus on are Model S deliveries and earnings per share.
Although expected earnings of 56 cents for 2014 would be down from 78 cents the prior year, the result would mark a second consecutive year in the black.
But that is on an adjusted, pro-forma basis. The company’s reported result will be negative, as it always has been. The gap is due to differences in the treatment of share compensation, leases and nearly $3 billion in convertible notes.
Those securities, which can be converted into stock at various share prices, get surprisingly little notice. The higher the stock price, currently about $217, goes over the next six years, the more dilution of existing shareholders that occurs as the securities are converted from debt into equity.
That’s a high-class problem, naturally. If the stock doesn’t appreciate by at least 160% in that time, though, Tesla could have to repay or refinance a big slug of the convertible notes. It would be challenging.
True, the stock has risen 460% over the past two years. Yet, in the past 12 months, the company produced only $158 million in cash flow. So the success of its mass-market model and battery-producing “Gigafactory” are necessary not just for growth but for survival. It’s enough for even Tesla’s biggest fans to recheck their seat belts.

  GM Favors Michigan to Build Bolt Electric

    Auto Maker Would Consolidate Production of Its Plug-In Vehicles in Home State

small-car factory in Orion, Mich., is favored to build the Chevrolet Bolt, an electric car slated to go on sale in coming years as a rival to

and
Inc., said people familiar with the matter.
By choosing the Orion plant, GM executives would breathe fresh life into a plant that was expected to be closed during the company’s 2009 restructuring. The State of Michigan offered $779 million business tax credits over 20 years to save the plant, prompting GM to choose the site for production of the subcompact Chevrolet Sonic and small Buick Verano sedan.
The Bolt, which will be fitted with a


battery pack, could go into production by late 2016, these people said, and go on sale in early 2017. The car is expected to go up to 200 miles on a single charge. The vehicle will carry an about $30,000 price tag and compete with a similarly-priced entrant from Tesla, also due about that time, along with a beefed up version of the Nissan Leaf electric car.
A GM spokesman declined to comment on the location of the Bolt’s production. Reuters first reported the news of the plans.
The Orion plant was expected to close in 2009 as part of GM’s restructuring, but the site beat out factories in Wisconsin and Tennessee to produce the subcompact Sonic. While auto makers, including GM, typically lose money on the lowest-end cars in the market, building a fuel-efficient subcompact in Michigan was seen as an important step for the auto maker to build more environmentally-friendly cars and trucks.
Local officials threw in $102 million in incentives and federal worker-training funds of $130 million helped sway GM to keep the plant open in 2009. It is unclear if GM is seeking additional incentives in exchange for Bolt production.
The selection of the Orion plant promises to play a significant role in GM’s negotiations with the United Auto Workers this summer. Future product commitments to U.S. plants has always been a negotiating chip for auto makers looking for bargaining leverage with union counterparts.
The Michigan site will be relatively close to battery production, according to people familiar with the details. LG will make the Bolt batteries in Holland, Mich., a city located on the state’s west side.
GM currently builds the Chevrolet Volt, a less capable plug-in hybrid vehicle, in Hamtramck, Mich. Due for a redesign this year, the Volt has about 50 miles of electric driving range and has a small gasoline engine on board in case juice runs out.
The auto maker cannot run the Volt and the Bolt down the same line because the Hamtramck plant already builds a number of vehicles in that factory. That plant, located near GM’s headquarters, is running severely below capacity, according to WardsAuto.com, producing 47,368 vehicles last year, or 45.8% fewer than in 2013.
The Orion plant, located 35 miles from GM headquarters, also is in need of a hit model. The company began laying off as many as 160 Orion workers in January because of declining demand for small cars. The Michigan decision was a strategic decision to keep most of GM’s electric car efforts housed in its home state, and the latest salvo in an extensive effort by the auto maker to consolidate its sprawling operations into fewer locations.
New-car production was up across the U.S. last year. According to WardsAuto.com, factory output for each of the Detroit Three was down in the Great Lakes state, falling a combined 8% compared with 2013. GM’s Michigan output declined 7% as four of its five plants there built fewer vehicles.
Auto manufacturing employment in the U.S., however, climbed yet again last month rising to 913,200 jobs, up from 846,300 in January 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That represents the highest mark since 2008.

  Japanese Industrial Robot Maker Fanuc Ramps Up Production

    Move comes after hedge-fund investor Daniel Loeb reveals stake in company

TOKYO—Japanese industrial-robot maker


said it would invest more than $1 billion in new factories and research facilities at home, days after one of New York’s most well-known hedge funds called on it to return more cash to investors.
Fanuc, whose machine tools and robots are used to make iPhones for

and cars for

said Monday it would spend about ¥100 billion on a factory aimed at “fortification” of its production capabilities and about ¥30 billion on laboratories aimed at enhancing the reliability and speed of its equipment.
The company didn’t make note of a letter to investors from hedge fund Third Point LLC, run by 



      Daniel Loeb, 



       which last week disclosed an unspecified stake in Fanuc and criticized the company for an “illogical capital structure which does nothing for shareholder value.” Third Point, which is known for taking sizable stakes in companies and then demanding they take action to raise shareholder returns, called on Fanuc to use some of its $8.5 billion cash hoard to repurchase shares. Fanuc “reminds us of Apple in its product approach,” the letter said.
But some Japan watchers said Fanuc’s capital-spending plan effectively rebuffs Third Point’s proposal.
Mr. Loeb wrote in an email that the Fanuc plan was “not inconsistent” with his proposal.
“Announcing a plan to invest in Japanese growth does not change our thesis as they are talking about spending a bit over $1 billion … all the while the company generates roughly $2 billion of free cash every year,” Mr. Loeb wrote.
Fanuc declined to comment on Third Point’s letter and its request for a share buyback. In its Monday statement, it said it acquired land for the new factories in September, which would be well before Mr. Loeb’s interest in the company came to light.
Third Point didn’t respond immediately to a request for comment, citing the Presidents Day holiday in the U.S.
Mr. Loeb—who last year decided to sell Third Point’s stake in

after
—is increasing his activism in Japan at an opportune time. Overseas investors, drawn by record corporate profits, have helped push Tokyo stock prices to their highest levels in more than seven years. As of March 2014, foreigners owned 31% of Japanese companies’ shares, including 52.5% at Fanuc. The government of Prime Minister 



      Shinzo Abe



       has joined foreign investors in calling on Japanese companies to be more responsive to shareholder interests.
But the run on Fanuc, which was spun out from

in 1972, puts Mr. Loeb head-to-head with one of Japan’s most quirky and standoffish public companies.
Based near Mount Fuji, Fanuc is known for its secretive culture, restricting email contact with the outside world and limiting communications with analysts and investors to official financial filings, such as its quarterly earnings reports.
Fanuc kept all its manufacturing in Japan, even as most of the country’s industrial giants moved more factories to lower-cost locations overseas.
And Fanuc has managed to maintain a strong profit: In the nine months through Dec. 31, the company’s sales rose 61%, to ¥526 billion and its net profit doubled to ¥149 billion. The company cited strong demand for assembly-line robots from the U.S. and China, where factory automation is accelerating from a low base.
Sales of the company’s Robomachine tools nearly tripled, fueled by strong demand from smartphone makers. Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that Fanuc held an 18% share of the global robotics market in 2013, just ahead of ABB Group of Switzerland and another Japanese company,

, at 17% each.
Yukihiro Kumagai, 



       an analyst at Jefferies & Co., said that while Fanuc’s capital-spending plan didn’t rule out a buyback, the timing might have been intended to send a message.
“This company is saying it wants to create shareholder value through growth,” he said.
The company said the new factories, in Tochigi prefecture, north of Tokyo, would make motors, amplifiers and computer-controlled cutting machines. The start of production is slated for October 2016.
Bolstering domestic manufacturing is a significant goal of Mr. Abe’s economic-turnaround plan. Lured by a weaker yen, which makes domestic manufacturing more competitive, several manufacturers,


and electronics companies

and

, said recently that they planned to return some production to Japan from overseas.
Despite announcing a big increase in capital spending, which could reduce the company’s return on equity, a broad measure of profitability, Fanuc’s share price rose 3.4% Monday. Some investors said they were happy with the company’s approach of putting long-term growth ahead of short-term shareholder returns.
“There is no growth after returning money to the shareholders,” said 



      Yusuke Sakai, 



       a senior stock trader at T&D Asset Management Co., which manages ¥1.9 trillion in assets. “Of course, if you can do both, that’s the best.”

  Go Big Or Go Home

    A tome full of techno-optimism suggests the Silicon Valley elite really are different from the rest of us.

Just when you think the Silicon Valley technology crowd is like the rest of us, only richer and more into writing code, you read a book like“Bold” and are reminded that, no, these people are different. Not just superficially different, but profoundly so. As different as the silent Maine lobsterman from the loquacious Californian Reiki healer. A favorable spin is that, if you view the world as a technologist, its potential seems boundless. Science advances quickly; technology is fundamentally benign. No problems seem insuperable, and you don’t hear voices in your head yelling “Whoa!” in response to all yourhelter-skelter techno-optimism.
Peter H. Diamandis



       is a scientist who created the X Prize to stoke innovations in space flight and has also founded ventures in genomics, cell therapy and asteroid mining. 



      Steven Kotler



       is a writer who has a business trying to explain “flow,” that satisfying feeling he describes as “the complete merger between action and awareness.” Their last book, “Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think,” was a giddy ride through all the ways we are making life better—from clean water to better health care and more accessible education. “Bold: How to Go Big, Create Wealth and Impact the World” is a similar booster shot of tech-think vitamin C.
It starts out by contrasting “exponential entrepreneurs” against the “linear-thinking executives” who work in major corporations. The exponential entrepreneurs are “paving the way for a new world of abundance” by finding big problems and exploiting the “Six D’s”: digitalization, deception, disruption, demonetization, dematerialization, democratization.
Take the case of
and photography. First came the technology that allowed photographs to be taken and stored digitally rather than on film—digitization. But it seemed too trivial for a giant like Kodak to worry about—an act of self-deception. Then came disruption, when digital photography grew from a tiny niche into a big business and then surpassed print photography. People no longer needed to pay to store or share their photographs because free digital services had sprung up. Kodak found itself demonetized. Then photography was dematerialized, as cameras were built into phones and the physical materials of the darkroom were replaced by digital tools. Finally, the entire process was democratized, since anyone with a phone can (at no additional cost) take pictures, edit them and share them.
In 1996 Kodak employed 140,000 people and had a market value of $28 billion. In January 2012 it filed for bankruptcy. Instagram was founded in October 2010 and was bought by
in April 2012 for $1 billion. It had 13 employees at the time. Instagram was the definition of an exponential organization, one “whose impact (or output)—because of its use of networks or automation and/or its leveraging of the crowd—is disproportionally large compared to its number of employees.” The Six D’s, the authors make clear, are leaving the poor executives who think in linear rather than exponential fashion in a state of three D’s: “distraught, depressed and departed.”

Diamandis and Kotler divide their book into three sections, “Bold Technology,” “Bold Mindset” and “The Bold Crowd.” In the first, they assert that five exponential technologies will change the world: networks and sensors; infinite computing (or the ever decreasing cost and increasing power of computing); artificial intelligence; robotics; and synthetic biology, the treatment of DNA as software that can be reprogrammed to optimize our health. It all sounds tremendously exciting, until it becomes appalling. 



      Ray Kurzweil,

head of artificial intelligence, says of his work: “It’s a shift from computers having only logical intelligence to ones that also have emotional intelligence. Once that occurs, AIs will be funny, get your jokes, be sexy, be loving, and even be creative.” Must they? And do we also need house plants that tweet at us when they need to be watered?
The authors prefer to rhapsodize rather than analyze the consequences of technological advance. Of robots in factories, they write: “Robots don’t unionize, don’t show up late, and don’t take lunch.” They also cost only $4 an hour. Millions of American jobs are at risk of being replaced by computers in the coming years, but, “good or bad, this same trend is evident around the world.” Good or bad? Well there’s the rub, and Messrs. Diamandis and Kotler drive by it at speed.
In the sections called “Bold Mindset” and “The Bold Crowd,” the authors probe for the secrets of their bold heroes, a group including Tesla CEO 



      Elon Musk, 



       Google CEO 



      Larry Page, 



       Amazon CEO 



      Jeff Bezos



       and Virgin CEO 



      Richard Branson.



       They argue that going bold requires crowdsourcing and crowdfunding—that is, soliciting ideas, services and funding from a large group of people, mostly strangers, online. They fail to note that few of the really big businesses they claim to admire have done either.
The great lie about so much technology is that it has enabled a more sharing, more democratic age. But too much of the “sharing” that happens online seems to involve people abandoning their livelihoods to the owners of “platforms”—letting the masses be demonetized and dematerialized for the enrichment of a few. Too much of the “democracy” feels like voyeurism or surveillance. The crowd is not just sourcing and funding this new economy; it’s also getting fleeced.
The authors glance at these issues in the final two pages of their book. Of our era of exponential networks and sensors, they write: “Someone will always be watching. While this raises serious concerns for privacy, it also offers us hope for the end of oppression and perhaps the beginning of an entirely new breed of moral global leadership.” Right. I understand. They’re busy guys. We can figure out the boring stuff. I only hope they Skype us once in a while from the asteroid mine.

  Tesla: The Road to Riches Is Littered With Potholes

    Fourth-Quarter Miss Raises Questions About Car Maker’s Ability to Ramp Up Production

When

reported fourth-quarter results late Wednesday that fell short of expectations, it gave several explanations that investors have heard from many other companies, and one that was completely new.
There was severe weather, shipping problems and the effect of the strong dollar, all the old standbys. And then there was the problem of customers being away on vacation in December, and therefore not available to take delivery of their new electric cars.
So the 9,834 vehicles that Tesla delivered came in below what analysts had estimated, as well as the number of cars it actually built during the quarter. Revenue missed, too. The company made a loss of 13 cents a share, excluding stock-based compensation and some other costs, versus a consensus expectation that it would earn a profit of 31 cents.
All these problems might come out in this year’s wash. Tesla said that 1,400 deliveries it planned to make in December were instead done in the first quarter. But until investors see the first-quarter figures, the possibility that the recent decline in gasoline prices has cut into demand for the company’s cars will hang in the air. And if lower pump prices might be affecting the well-heeled customers who buy the vehicles the company now has on offer, what might they mean for the mass-market model Tesla plans to release in 2017?
The greater concern may be how smoothly Tesla will be able to scale up production to the levels it must reach to justify the stock’s triple-digit multiple of forward earnings. The operational problems it encountered in the fourth quarter came on top of a third quarter when downtime in its Fremont, Calif., production facility ran longer than planned, and the company also pushed the release of its Model X SUV back to the third quarter of this year.
Indeed, while Tesla shipped nearly 3,000 more cars in the fourth quarter than it did a year earlier, analysts are looking for it to ship something on the order of 10 times as many cars per quarter by 2020. And that will have to be done, at relatively high profit margins, even as big competitors ranging from
to
launch and refine rival vehicles.
To justify its current valuation, let alone some of Wall Street’s lofty targets, Tesla must pull all this off while avoiding production snafus. If such a tall order wasn’t being questioned already, the last two quarters should change that.

  GM Confirms Plan to Build Long-Range Electric Car in Michigan

    Auto Maker to Invest $200 Million in Two Facilities to Build Chevrolet Bolt Concept

CHICAGO—


confirmed it will build a long-range electric car at a Michigan factory that was
during the 2009 government bailout of the auto maker.
GM will invest $160 million in the Orion, Mich., assembly plant located in Detroit’s northern suburbs to prepare it for electric-vehicle production. The announcement comes only a few months before labor talks with the United Auto Workers union, and U.S. product sourcing decisions often play a significant role in negotiations.
Based on the Chevrolet Bolt concept car shown at last month’s Detroit auto show, the car is expected to go on sale in 2017 with a $30,000 price tag and be
with Tesla Motors Inc. and Nissan Motor Co. electric vehicles.
Building an electric vehicle in the U.S. is a financial risk, as the combination of soft demand for battery-powered vehicles and high costs of the technology could lead to losses if aggressive production targets are missed.
The Orion plant in 2009 was the recipient of $1 billion in promised grants and local tax incentives from the State of Michigan, local municipalities and federal authorities. Slated for closure during GM’s bankruptcy, the plant was awarded production of the Chevrolet Sonic subcompact car and a Buick sedan.
Demand for small cars has weakened as gasoline prices remain relatively low, forcing GM to cut jobs late last year at the Orion plant in an effort to stem losses.
GM’s decision to put an electric car in the plant was announced Thursday by the company’s North America chief, 



      Alan Batey, 



       during a speech in Chicago. He said the electric car, with an estimated 200 mile range per charge, has the “potential to shake up the status quo for electric vehicles.”
GM will also invest $40 million in a plant in Pontiac, Mich., which houses a die shop related to Bolt production.

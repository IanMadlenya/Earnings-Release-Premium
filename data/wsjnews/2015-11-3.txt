  Faraday Future Aims to Take on Tesla Motors With $1 Billion Investment 

    Startup promises to deliver a long-range, premium electric car in 2017

Faraday Future Inc., an electric-car startup aiming to take on


on Thursday said it is considering four states for a $1 billion factory that would begin making its first cars in 2017.
The Gardena, Calif., company launched 18 months ago with private funding, has grown to more than 400 employees. Faraday Future Product Development Chief 



      Nick Sampson



       said the company is looking at sites in Nevada, Louisiana, Georgia and California for the plant and would announce the site “in the next few weeks.”
Mr. Sampson is one of a team of former Tesla executives now leading Faraday Future. Like Tesla, Faraday Future is named after an inventor from the 19th century.
Tesla, more than a decade old, has shown how costly it is to break into the auto industry with electric cars. Even though volumes have steadily grown in recent years, the Palo Alto, Calif., car maker has posted 10-consecutive quarterly losses as a public company and routinely
more than $100 million in cash a month, requiring a steady pipeline of new financing.
Faraday Future has recruited personnel from

and

in addition to Tesla. It has promised to deliver a long-range, premium electric car sometime in 2017 that rivals Tesla’s pricey Model S sedan.
The $1 billion investment plan is a significant commitment for a company that is virtually unknown. Faraday declined to say where it is getting the funds to finance the manufacturing plant.
“That sort of an amount is going to come from a different number of sources,” said Mr. Sampson, who was the lead chassis engineer for Tesla’s Model S before leaving in early 2012. “We are keeping our partners confidential.”

We are keeping our partners confidential.

The company has been adding dozens of employees every month and is renovating

former Southern California sales headquarters as its home location.
Faraday’s plan is to break ground on the plant in early 2016 and begin production sometime in 2017. It is considering a rebuild of an existing factory or building a new plant from the ground up. Mr. Sampson said the company has secured parts suppliers and has begun to make purchase orders for components.
Faraday is one of several companies attempting to create an electric car to compete with Tesla. Ateiva Inc., backed by Beijing Automobile Industry Holding Corp. and Leshi Internet & Technology Co.,
in Silicon Valley. It is run by a former a Tesla engineer, 



      Bernard Tse.
Karma Automotive, formerly Fisker Automotive, which is based in Southern California, has revived its hopes after China’s Wanxiang Group Corp. bought the failed hybrid-electric supercar maker out of bankruptcy in 2014. The company has secured a manufacturing facility in Southern California and is planning to sell a new car in 2016, according to its Web page.
Faraday was operating under the radar until a few months ago when it announced its intentions. Its first vehicle will have a battery pack that is larger than the one offered on Tesla Model S or Model X and will feature a variety of connected car features. But Mr. Sampson wouldn’t elaborate beyond that.

  Jack Andraka’s Parents on Raising a Science Whiz Kid

    After Jack Andraka took home the top prize at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair at age 15, his family steered him through accolades, opportunities and backlash

of you licking that?” 18-year-old 



      Jack Andraka



       asks his mother, Jane. He points to a large metal globe sitting atop a 3-foot-tall, 10,000-volt Tesla coil. When Jack flicks on the contraption it makes a cacophonous roar and shoots off jagged purple sparks. “The smell is plasma,” he explains. “It’s the fourth state of matter, when things get superheated.” The Andrakas’ basement quickly fills with the nose-crinkling odor of burnt air.
The rec room of the suburban Crownsville, Maryland, home of Steve and Jane Andraka and their two sons, Jack and Luke, has been transformed into a makeshift laboratory. Ever since Jack cultured dangerous
bacteria on the kitchen stove in fifth grade, left a bowl with nanoparticle residue on the counter that his cousin then accidentally ate cereal out of and helped Luke (his older brother by two years) destroy the family microwave by zapping aluminum foil in it to see what might happen, Mom and Dad have forced the boys’ experiments downstairs. The air hockey table teems with transformers, spools of wire and welding masks. “We buy them all the safety equipment, and they never wear it,” Steve says.
“Some parents need to worry about their kids going to drug and alcohol parties,” Jane says. “In our neighborhood, they need to worry about their kids coming over here and getting electrocuted. Addicted to science, I guess.”
The Andraka home has long been a place of chaos, with pet ferrets running around on the floor, shipments of esoteric lab chemicals showing up in the mailbox and two boys intent on pushing the boundaries of both DIY experimentation and parental patience. But life went into warp drive when Jack won big at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, in 2012, as a 15-year-old high school freshman. Jack’s method for detecting certain early-stage cancers using a nonintrusive test took the top prize of $75,000. A
at the big moment has been viewed nearly a million times: He screams, falls to the ground, hugs everyone in sight and beams as a squall of confetti rains over his head. “I didn’t think there was any chance he’d win,” Jane says. “I’d brought a little toy gun full of confetti that I was going to shoot on him in the parking lot after he lost.”
In the wake of his award, and his winsome, spontaneous reaction, Jack turned into a surprise celebrity. He appeared on
Michelle Obama invited him as her guest at the State of the Union address. He met the president and the pope. “I love the Clintons,” Jack says. “They’re the best; they’re super nice to me, and I see them all the time.” Jack now
and delivers paid speeches all over the globe. His autobiography,
was published by HarperCollins earlier this year—it describes Jack’s struggle to overcome childhood bullying, his decision to come out as gay in middle school and the remarkable discovery he hopes will eventually help save lives.
Supporting Jack at every turn have been his parents. Steve and Jane met on the whitewater-rafting circuit, working for an outfitter in West Virginia. Steve was a guide, and Jane had competed on a women’s national kayaking team. Jane works as an anesthetist; Steve is a civil engineer—and the pair created a home environment in which science and math were revered. They’d stroll the creek at the edge of their property and use the walk as a way for their boys to learn about macroinvertebrates or water-quality remediation. “If you know the science around things, it’s so much more interesting to lift up rocks and make hypotheses and have conversations that the kids can get into,” Jane says. “We made sure they were covered with true learning experiences,” says Steve, “and a lot of our dinner conversations would be about science.”
When Jack’s and Luke’s aptitude and interest became obvious, their parents enrolled them in a local charter school with a science and math bent. Meanwhile, Jane searched far and wide for after-school and summer programs. There were math teams, engineering contests and science fairs. “Kids get out of class at two or three,” says Jane, “and either they can look at TV all afternoon, or you can find supplemental activities for them. It’s all there online, and a lot of it’s free. You just search for things like ‘math and 12-year-old.’ ”
There were sacrifices for Steve and Jane—mainly, a punishing amount of driving, up to an hour-and-a-half each way to various activities, followed by waiting around in parking lots for educational sessions to end. “There’s not a lot of time to work on your personal self,” Jane says. “But kids grow up and then they’re gone so fast, and they’re your gift to the world. You only get one chance. You can’t push the reset button and go back. So you might as well put the time and energy into it.”
The family experienced its bleakest moment when Jack broke down in eighth grade, harming himself in a school bathroom as he came to grips with both his sexuality and the cruelty of bullying classmates. He’d hidden the strain from his parents until a guidance counselor called them in. “I was the golden child who won science fairs and math competitions, and I felt like I couldn’t show weakness,” Jack says now.
“We didn’t recognize he was having problems,” Steve says. “He was scared to tell me he was gay. But I looked in his eyes and made him understand that I love him as my son. I’m not going to change him and I’m not going to abandon him.”
Jack emerged from the crisis more driven than before. “The bullying made him want to prove he was better than them,” Steve says. When a close family friend died from pancreatic cancer, in 2011, Jack found his mission. Through his own research, he identified a promising method for early cancer detection—one that relied on simple paper strips and could be carried out more quickly and cheaply than previous techniques. He then wrote letters to 200 scientists asking for lab space to bring his project to fruition. Only Dr. Anirban Maitra, then of Johns Hopkins and now of the MD Anderson Cancer Center, recognized Jack’s potential and accepted him into his lab. Suddenly a 14-year-old who hadn’t yet passed high school biology was working alongside university grad students. Jack spent five or six days a week on the Johns Hopkins campus, which meant even more grueling driving for Steve and Jane.

Some people at first made him out to be Jesus Christ, but really he was just a 14-year-old who had a really cool idea with a lot of promise.

It all paid off when Jack won ISEF. Astounding accolades and opportunities followed. But with them arrived a measure of backlash, as some journalists downplayed the significance of Jack’s discovery, which the Andrakas say is fair: “Some people at first made him out to be Jesus Christ,” Jane says, “but really he was just a 14-year-old who had a really cool idea with lots of promise.”
Jack’s patent on his biosensor process is pending, and it will require years of testing and regulatory approvals to be brought to market. The Andrakas hope a biomedical company will turn Jack’s concept into a product that appears on drugstore shelves. “It was definitely overhyped in some cases,” Jack says. “But it was also extreme to say that it was nothing at all.” For his part, Jack’s already begun to move on to a couple of new projects—one involving nanorobots and another focusing on water quality.
Steve and Jane are looking forward to things quieting down. “It took over our lives for a while,” Jane says. (They turned down an offer to film a reality-television show in their home.)
For them, the two best things to come out of all this have been the money Jack receives for his speaking gigs and book—which will help pay tuition at Stanford University, where he is a freshman—and the empathy Jack has learned from meeting with cancer patients and survivors. “It’s made him a more compassionate person,” Steve says. “He used to be so clinical,” says Jane, “but now he listens to people’s stories. I really like seeing that growth in him.”
Their advice to parents? “Don’t just tell your kids how smart they are,” suggests Jane. “Praise your kids’ effort and persistence. Tell them that failure is fine and that you like the way they work through things.” They’re excited to see where Jack’s interests will take him next.
“College is going to open his eyes up even more, and he’s going to evolve,” Steve says.
“It’s time for him to fly now,” says Jane.

  China Auto Giant’s Tesla Dreams Are Hard to Fathom

For any Chinese company wondering how to make its stock go up after diluting shareholders, the country’s largest car maker has a plan. Promise adherence to one of the nation’s policy nostrums of the time—or, in this case, two.
The Shanghai-listed shares of state-run SAIC Motor, the local partner for
and


leapt 10% Friday, the daily limit for mainland Chinese stocks. Partly the shares, which have been suspended for a month, are catching up to the rise in the broader Shanghai markets. But there is also the news that the company would issue $2.3 billion of new shares that dilute existing owners by 8%, calculates Jefferies.
Why don’t these shareholders mind getting diluted? SAIC will start an employee stock ownership plan, with about 8% of the new shares going to that. In China, such plans have become synonymous with reform of state-controlled enterprises, inspiring a rally earlier this year in the shares of


Ford’s local partner.
The theory is that with shares in their pockets, management’s incentives might become better aligned with minority shareholders’. Yet the Shanghai local government that runs SAIC Motor remains in control, meaning in practice cues from the state may outweigh those from investors.
The plan should also please China’s stock market bailout managers, since it forbids employees from selling shares for up to three years. Other new investors are locked in for a year.
The second excitement is that SAIC has earmarked the new capital to give itself some

magic. More than half of the $2.3 billion will go to build electric and hybrid car vehicles, as well as auto finance and, curiously, cloud computing. The going green part shows SAIC toeing the line with antipollution goals touted in China’s recently outlined 13th Five Year Plan.
But investors shouldn’t be so excited. SAIC
and anything to come out of these investments will take years. And there is a good chance Chinese consumers will prefer foreign electric-car technology over indigenous ones, just as they currently do for gasoline-powered cars.
SAIC’s ventures with GM and Volkswagen
and stand to benefit from China’s cut in the car-sales tax last year. This is more or less priced in at 7.1 times forward earnings, which puts SAIC smack in the middle of peers. Skeptical investors should see the capital raise, and the electric vehicle dreams, as cause to distance themselves from SAIC, not draw closer.

  Tesla Results: Burning Rubber and Cash   

    Tesla’s third-quarter results offered investors some positive signs. But big negative ones still loom over its route.

In
,

reminded investors on Tuesday that profitably scaling the business remains a tough nut to crack.
Third-quarter revenue came in at $937 million and the company lost $1.78 per share, according to generally accepted accounting principles. These figures missed analyst expectations.
The stock shot up in after-hours trading, though. That is because, for Tesla, current results matter less to shareholders than projections. On that front, Tesla scored well: The company maintained the low end of its 2015 vehicle delivery guidance of 50,000 vehicles, a figure the market had been looking at with skepticism. That implies a large increase in fourth-quarter deliveries.
Tesla also affirmed earlier guidance that it expects to produce cars next year at a rate of 1,600 to 1,800 vehicles a week. So investors can cross
off their list of worries, for now.
But larger concerns remain. There is
. And, even if it overcomes this, the more cars Tesla sells, the worse its financial results seem to get. Automotive gross margins dropped to 22.8%; it was 25% in the first quarter. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, came in at negative $595 million, the worst on record.
Analysts expect a minuscule free-cash outflow in the fourth quarter, and Tesla chief 



      Elon Musk



       said he aspires to achieve positive cash flow in 2016’s first quarter. This would mark a huge improvement, but things are currently pointing in the wrong direction.
That is worrisome given the shares still trade at more than 120 times forward earnings. In coming months, Tesla needs to reverse the worsening trend of negative operating leverage. Otherwise, investors could get a shock.

  Soon, Power Will Be Delivered to Your Device by Air 

    Four basic types of technology are vying to achieve Tesla’s vision of wireless transmission

In 1902 workers completed a mysterious tower, 187 feet high and shaped like a giant mushroom, on which rested the hopes of one of the 20th century’s most prolific geniuses.
Facing the beach in the hamlet of Shoreham, N.Y., on Long Island, the Wardenclyffe Tower was, according to its inventor, Nikola Tesla, the key that could unlock an age of wonders.
As Mr. Tesla later wrote, the tower’s ability to transmit information to the far side of the Earth would someday allow the creation of “an inexpensive instrument, not bigger than a watch, [which] will enable its bearer to hear anywhere, on sea or land, music or song however distant.”
Sometime in 2016, Tesla’s other prediction—that it isn’t only possible, but commercially viable, to transmit power as well as information through the air, without wires—is expected to come true.
What is coming are hermetically sealed smartphones and other gadgets that charge without ever plugging into a wall. And soon after there will be sensors, cameras and controllers that can be stuck to any surface, indoors or out, without the need to consider how to connect them to power.
Wireless power will be, in other words, not just a convenience, but a fundamental enabler of whole new platforms.
The players in this field are myriad, but their technology can be boiled down to four basic types.
There are those power mats you may have seen at Starbucks, an older technology that hasn’t been widely adopted.
The second, pioneered by the 8-year-old company WiTricity, is slated to show up in
-chip-powered laptops sometime in 2016. It uses “magnetic resonance” to efficiently transmit power, over distances ranging from centimeters to a meter.
“It’s really charging that Intel notebook as if you’d plugged it in,” says WiTricity Chief Executive 



      Alex Gruzen.
But it is the third and fourth kinds of wireless power that are the most intriguing, because they involve beaming power over significant distances.
One, which the startups
and Ossia are racing to commercialize, involves transmitting power more or less as Mr. Tesla envisioned—through radio waves.
And the last, pioneered by uBeam, involves transmitting power through sound waves.
The challenge with these approaches isn’t technology, but physics. Radio waves, after all, are in the same range as the waves generated by a microwave oven. There’s only so much energy you can beam through the air without cooking whatever gets in the way.
Energous CTO 



      Michael Leabman



       claims his two-year-old company has this problem licked, and not because of breakthroughs in focusing radio waves. The key, experts say, is that mobile devices use less power than ever.
“It’s really the chip makers who deserve most of the credit for this stuff,” says 



      Gregory Durgin, 



       a Georgia Institute of Technology professor who is an expert on wireless transmission of power. He says the claims that Energous is making for its technology are in line with his own experience.
A typical smartphone might be able to charge quickly from a wall outlet putting out 5 watts, but if you can—as Energous claims—beam up to 2 watts of power over a distance of 10 feet, to a small radio antenna embedded in that phone, you can “trickle charge” it in a matter of hours.
If you think about how much time we typically spend in our offices and homes, this is a perfectly reasonable way to almost guarantee that we’ll never have a dead phone again, especially if our devices start charging automatically the moment we walk in the door.
Energous has shown off a workable demo, and Mr. Leabman says the company’s technology will be a mass-market product by the end of 2016 or early 2017.
Just as exciting is the potential of wireless energy to solve the problem that has always plagued the Internet of Things—or the idea that we will cover our entire world in sensors and tiny motors that control devices, leading to “smart” everything. The hitch is, how to power all those little chips and their electronics, some of which may be as small and thin as a stick-on price tag.
Energous already has a patent on the idea of putting a power transmitter into the base of a light bulb, allowing its technology to cover an entire room, and putting out enough power that a device 15 feet away could absorb one watt.
“Wireless power could enable a whole new class of devices,” says Mr. Durgin. Those devices will include sensors on all the mechanics of a home, business or factory; detectors for heat, light and motion; and cameras and controls that we can move and upgrade at our convenience, without ever having to touch the building’s wiring.
These controls will include “peel and stick” light switches and thermostats, which are already a common senior design project among Prof. Durgin’s students.
Meredith Perry, 



       CEO of uBeam, says that her company’s technology will be able to beam more power, via ultrasound waves, over greater distances than what is claimed by companies like Energous, and that uBeam will unveil a working prototype by the end of 2016.
Both of these technologies face major issues. In the case of uBeam, experts I spoke with were skeptical that, based on the physics involved, the company can deliver on its promises.
Moreover, energy transmitted via radio waves represents a major pollution of the bands of unregulated spectrum that already are crowded with everything from microwave ovens to Wi-Fi routers. That could limit the places wireless power can be used.
So it isn’t likely that the three-prong outlet will be obsolete anytime soon, but it is likely that in the near future ambient power could be commonplace.
It would be the ultimate vindication of Mr. Tesla, a hundred years after his tower project shut down for lack of funds.


Michael Leabman is the chief technology officer at startup Energous. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said he was CEO. (10/30/15)

  Tesla Motors Can’t Maintain ‘Ludicrous’ Speed

    With skepticism growing, Tesla can still get away with losses. But it will also need to hit delivery targets to keep its ludicrous valuation.

Its sedan’s top acceleration mode isn’t the only thing
about



Ask many observers, and the company’s full-year delivery target of between 50,000 and 55,000 vehicles is starting to look that way.
the company released about the third quarter—it unveils complete results Tuesday—it has delivered 33,157 so far in 2015. Tacking on an additional 16,843 to 21,843 seems a tall order given likely teething problems around making its new Model X sport-utility vehicle.
But deliveries for a car with what the company says is a long waiting list are a short-term issue. What matters is the company’s ability to eventually make money, and preferably lots of it, to support a nearly $28 billion market value—1½ times that of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV with around 1% of its unit sales.
The third quarter of 2015 will likely repeat the same pattern of each reporting period going back as far as the beginning of last year—sharply lowered expectations that the company may or may not clear. Each quarter was seen as profitable a year earlier and the company still hasn’t achieved that distinction, except on a pro forma basis. Analysts think Tesla will report a loss of 79 cents a share for the period, under generally accepted accounting principles, compared with a loss of 52 cents in the same period a year earlier.
There are signs that investors and analysts are starting to separate their wonder at Tesla’s technical accomplishments and shiny vision of the future from economic reality.
last month coincided with a rash of lowered recommendations or target prices for the stock.
Given how much of its market value hinges on its mass-market sedan, which won’t even begin to go on sale until 2016, delays of mere thousands of vehicles or quality snafus shouldn’t matter much in theory. But they do because they serve as a reality check on extremely ambitious plans in an increasingly competitive electric-vehicle market. For that reason, Tuesday’s delivery update could have an outsize impact.
After blinding acceleration, it is time to change gears.

  Tesla Loss Widens, but Investors Cheer Sales Outlook

    Shares climb more than 10% after hours

Tesla Motors Inc., the maker of luxury electric vehicles, posted a wider loss of $229.9 million in the third quarter as costs to launch the Model X sport-utility late in September led to a 10th-consecutive quarter of red ink.
Despite the loss, which was coupled with heavy cash use of nearly $450 million, investors cheered the results because the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company stuck to its sales-target goals for the year.
Shares climbed sharply after hours, up 11% to $230.28.
Revenue rose 10% to $936.8 million, but heavy development costs offset the benefit of steady volume growth. On an adjusted basis, which accounts for deferred revenue related to vehicles it leases, revenue rose 33% to $1.24 billion, which was slightly below analysts’ projections.
Tesla’s adjusted operating loss was 58 cents per share, deeper than the 50-cent loss analysts had anticipated. The adjustments account for employee stock grants and deferred revenue for the lease program it uses for many of its sales.
The Model X, the auto maker’s second volume vehicle, went on sale late in the quarter and didn’t affect the results.
Still, Tesla predicted that it would deliver 17,000 to 19,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a good sign that production of the Model X will ramp up significantly and it could still achieve its sales targets for the year. The rate of production and sales of the new model is of great concern because the company already has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in preparing for the launch, and it needs the revenue from sales to pay for its continued growth.

      Joseph Spak



       said Tesla’s earnings were “not as bad as feared” and that investors liked the auto maker’s fourth-quarter forecast for deliveries.
The auto maker cautioned that its unique monopost second-row seats in the Model X might be the biggest threat to meeting sales targets. The company said it brought manufacturing of the seats in-house, a rarity in the auto industry.
Still, the company said it expected to be running its plant in Fremont, Calif., normally by the end of the first quarter of 2016 and that it would be able to produce and deliver 1,600 to 1,800 vehicles a week, or around 90,000 vehicles a year.
Tesla said its revenue was boosted by $39 million from the sale of pollution tax credits and $33 million from selling certified preowned vehicles in the quarter.
Tesla’s deliveries rose 49% to 11,603 in the third quarter, putting its annual deliveries through September at 33,140. Tesla has already lowered its sales forecast to 50,000 to 55,000 from 55,000. Tesla’s forecast for deliveries puts it at 50,000 to 52,000 in deliveries for the year.
Tesla shored up its cash balance in the quarter with a share sale that netted $750 million. Its cash supply of $1.4 billion is higher than the $1.2 billion it had on hand at the end of June, but considerably lower than the $2.37 billion it held on Sept. 30, 2014. Its cash use mostly went to pay for capital expenses, including the giant battery factory it is building in Nevada. That plant will begin making cells next year.

  Japanese Auto Makers Ramp Up Battery,  Hydrogen Plans     

    Honda, Nissan aim to capitalize on consumer dissatisfaction after Volkswagen emissions scandal

TOKYO—Japanese auto makers are honing plans to speed new battery- and hydrogen-powered vehicles to market, after the scandal over


diesel engines sparked renewed interest in other technologies to cut greenhouse-gas emissions.



said Wednesday at the Tokyo Motor Show that it would start leasing its Clarity Fuel Cell car, powered by hydrogen, in March with plans to sell it in the mass market soon.


showed an electric concept car with autonomous driving capabilities. The car carries a battery pack with twice the capacity of Nissan’s existing Leaf electric car, which would expand the driving range significantly if commercialized.
These developments and others, at the first big industry gathering since Volkswagen’s admission in September that it used software to manipulate diesel-emissions test results, underscore how Japan’s leading car makers could stand to benefit as the auto sector seeks alternatives to internal-combustion engines.
Japanese car makers make diesel cars, but they have generally played down the technology in reducing emissions.

began selling its first consumer fuel-cell vehicle, the Mirai, last year. The company this year plans to start selling an upgrade to its Prius hybrid car, which runs on gasoline and battery power.
“We had already some backlash on diesel before. So with this [scandal], it’s accelerating,” said 



      Carlos Ghosn, 



       the chief executive of both Nissan and

. Auto makers will have to be ready for the decline of diesel, especially in Europe, and other technologies will benefit from such a decline, he said. “Obviously gasoline, certainly, electric cars, plug-in hybrids, hybrids, maybe fuel-cell one day,” Mr. Ghosn said.
Volkswagen brand chief 



      Herbert Diess



       said that while the auto maker still believes diesel has a bright future, it is undergoing a shift. “Electrification is a trend in the industry. I think it’s irreversible. We will go and that’s why we also announced we will invest more money into electric cars,” he said at the Tokyo show.
The Japanese auto makers’ efforts to lead the pack in hydrogen and electric cars carry risks, as the technologies are still outliers that could be left behind if global demand doesn’t increase. Consumers have been reluctant to buy purely battery-powered cars because of limitations such as short driving range, while fuel-cell vehicles face a shortage of fueling stations.
Nissan introduced the Leaf in 2010 and says it has sold 195,000 of the cars to date, outselling

Model S and

Volt. Still, sales have been slower than Nissan hoped.
Nissan, which recently said it had lifted the range of the 2016 Leaf by 27%, to 107 miles, has also said it is developing a new lithium-ion battery system that could double the driving range, though that technology has yet to be commercialized.
“We are confident that in a relatively short period of time we will be able to solve the range-anxiety problem,” said 



      Trevor Mann, 



       Nissan’s chief performance officer.
Supporters of hydrogen add that the technology offers a greater driving range than current electric vehicles, providing an experience that is closer to that of cars equipped with internal-combustion engines. As more of these cars hit the roads, they say, infrastructure will follow.
A fuel-cell car is a type of electric vehicle that uses hydrogen as the fuel. It runs on the electricity that is generated when hydrogen is combined with oxygen inside a stack of cells packed in the car. The reaction’s byproduct is water, released in drops from the tail pipe.
The consumer introduction of Honda’s Clarity will follow 30 years of research on the technology at the company. The car, roughly the same size as the Accord sedan, will run at least 435 miles on a tank of hydrogen, based on Japanese testing standards, Honda said. That’s 700 kilometers—longer than the 650-kilometer range of Toyota’s Mirai.
Initially, Honda’s main customers will be the government, and it will sell the vehicle on the mass market after getting feedback from first users, the company said.
Toyota plans to make 700 Mirai cars in 2015, 2,000 next year and 3,000 in 2017. By 2020, it plans to sell at least 30,000 fuel-cell cars a year—compared with the 10 million vehicles the Toyota group sells in a year.
Toyota, which said this month that it envisioned alternative-powertrain vehicles accounting for most of its sales by 2050, unveiled a fourth-generation version of its Prius gasoline-electric hybrid car in September. Toyota is also considering an expansion of its fuel-cell lineup. Its luxury brand, Lexus, exhibited a fuel-cell concept car in Tokyo on Wednesday.

The Australian dollar fell more than 1% to as low as $0.7109 Wednesday after disappointing Australian inflation data boosted expectations that the central bank may cut interest rates at its meeting next week. The currency was last at $0.7122.
Third-quarter inflation rose 0.5% on-quarter, compared with a 0.7% increase expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Consumer prices rose 1.5% on-year.

In China, the defense sector fell 5% as investors cashed in on a jump of more than 7% the previous session. The sector rallied Tuesday after a U.S. Navy ship sailed close to artificial islands in the South China Sea claimed by China, escalating territorial tensions.
The sector’s near-term performance also will depend on whether leaders reveal new plans to boost the sector at their economic meeting in Beijing this week, according to analysts.

  Ford Moves Ford Credit CFO Michael Seneski to Director of Corporate Strategy   

    Move signals emphasis No. 2 U.S. auto maker is putting on forging partnerships with tech firms

is retooling its management team in a bid to catch up with Silicon Valley, moving a top finance executive to a corporate strategy office seeking partnerships with tech companies threatening to reshape the global auto industry.
Michael Seneski, 



       a Ford veteran instrumental in securing funding needed to weather the brutal auto industry downturn last decade, has left his job as chief financial officer of the Ford Motor Credit Co. lending arm to work for 



      John Casesa, 



       an investment banker hired to help update the 112-year-old car company’s business model. Mr. Casesa has been filling out a team since he joined Ford earlier this year.
A Ford spokesman confirmed the move on Monday but declined to make Mr. Seneski, 50, available for an interview. 



      Marion Harris



       has taken over as Ford Motor Credit’s finance chief.
The personnel moves follow a drive by senior leaders to slowly wade into new business arenas, including providing car-sharing services that resemble Zipcar. Responding to the emergence of Uber Technologies Inc. and

and the threat of competition from Google Inc. and

Mr. Casesa’s team of analysts and corporate strategists is figuring where to place future investment bets.
At a recent technology conference in Ireland, Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said the company is “going to have to migrate to new business models, which will be much more like transportation as a service.” Mr. Ford said “The car’s role in that may be diminished greatly, but there will be different revenue streams along the way.”
Mr. Seneski has a history of helping Ford navigate uncertainty. During the U.S. auto industry’s collapse in 2008-09, he led Ford’s effort to secure a $5.9 billion U.S. Energy Department loan that helped fund operations as the company’s Detroit rivals filed for bankruptcy.
In 2011, Mr. Seneski took the CFO post at Ford Motor Credit, which has $9 billion in revenue and consistently delivers substantial profits. Mr. Seneski also sits on the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s Detroit board.
This summer the lending arm began experimenting with car sharing, launching test programs in the U.S. and London that let car owners use mobile apps to offer their cars for short-term rentals.
Since taking the helm last year, Ford Chief Executive 



      Mark Fields



       has announced a string of so-called smart mobility experiments to better gage what the future of transportation might look like.
The test cases include everything from parking apps that help drivers locate free spots to new-ownership models, such as one it is investigating in India, where the car is shared among multiple drivers.
However, Ford isn’t alone in this effort. Rival General Motors Co. last month outlined its own “personal mobility” plan, which includes experiments with car-sharing, electric-powered bicycles and a fleet of self-driving cars, which it is testing on company grounds.
Other car makers are also playing defense. Earlier this year, for instance,

  Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks Rise as Energy Shares Rally

MARKETS AT A GLANCE
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT
Oil prices rallied Tuesday on concerns about output, and energy shares followed suit, helping U.S. stocks finish higher. Growing expectations for a Fed rate increase caused the dollar to strengthen and Treasurys and gold to sell off.
OPENING CALL
The New Zealand dollar is likely to come under further pressure after the labor market picture worsened. Statistics New Zealand said the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 6.0% in the three months to the end of September. While the figure was largely as expected, the participation rate was 68.6% versus an expected 69.3%. Also, seasonally adjusted employment fell 0.4% on the quarter versus expectations for a 0.4% rise and was up 1.5% on the year compared with expectations for a 2.5% rise. Statistics New Zealand said 11,000 fewer people were employed than in the June quarter, the first quarterly fall in employment in three years.
EQUITIES
U.S. stocks extended their gains Tuesday afternoon, as a rally in energy-company shares boosted major indexes.
Oil prices jumped on concerns about output from Libya and Brazil, and energy shares followed suit.
Chevron shares increased 3.4% to $98.14, while Exxon Mobil rallied 1.8% to $86.85.
“The fundamentals are pretty negative for these companies,” said Ted Weisberg, a trader at Seaport Securities. The stocks continue to act reasonably well. It tells us that...the worst perhaps is priced in.”
But the S&P’s consumer staples sector, one of the year’s better performers, dropped 0.5%, muting energy-related gains.
Cereal maker Kellogg’s shares declined 3.6% after reporting a drop in third-quarter earnings. Shares of grains processor and food-ingredient maker Archer Daniels Midland lost 6.8% after the company reported steeper-than-expected drops in revenue and profit for its third quarter.
Equity markets had fallen sharply in August and September, but rebounded in October on the prospect of support from the world’s central banks.
Still, some strategists aren’t convinced the rally will continue.
“We have high valuations but earnings growth has been sluggish. This isn’t really a positive environment for a further rally,” said Christian Stocker, an equity strategist at UniCredit.
Later in the week, the U.S. jobs report for October will be released as investors continue to speculate about the next Federal Reserve move on raise short-term interest rates.
Robust jobs growth would likely be a short-term negative for stock markets as it would increase the likelihood of a rate rise in December, said Ralf Zimmermann, equity strategist at German private bank Bankhaus Lampe.
In Asian trading Tuesday, Australia led most Asian markets higher, snapping six-straight days of losses, though Chinese blue-chip stocks dragged on mainland shares. Japan’s market was closed for a holiday.
FOREX
The dollar advanced against the euro and the yen, as investors braced for the Federal Reserve to tighten interest rates, possibly as soon as its December policy meeting.
The dollar rose 0.5% against the euro. Its U.S. counterpart increased 0.2% versus the yen.
More investors predict the Fed will raise its short-term, benchmark interest rate from near zero over the coming months, as global growth fears ease and markets calm. Analysts and traders expect that higher U.S. interest rates would draw investors to the dollar as central banks around the globe are easing policy and some are even considering additional stimulus measures to bolster growth and inflation.
Investors now have shifted their attention to U.S. nonfarm payrolls numbers for October and November for economic signals that could persuade the Fed to raise borrowing costs before the end of 2015. The U.S. Department of Labor will release the October jobs report on Friday.
“Now, more stable [financial] markets, reduced concerns about China and emerging markets, are likely to eliminate Fed objections for raising rates,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at the currency brokerage Commonwealth Foreign Exchange. “The dollar probably remains confined to recent trading ranges ahead of payrolls until we get more clarity from the data. If data support the notion of higher rates in December, the dollar will have more room to run.”
BONDS
U.S. government bond yields rose to their highest levels in nearly seven weeks, fueled by growing anxiety over an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve in December.
Investors have been lightening up on bonds following the Fed’s signal a week ago that a rate increase before the end of this year remains on the table. Traders say concerns over the Fed continue to be a main factor behind the bond market’s trading in the weeks ahead. Bond prices fall as their yields rise.
The Fed’s ultraloose monetary policy since the financial crisis has helped bolster bond prices to very high levels from a historical standpoint. Investors are worried that a shift into tightening policy would shrink the value of outstanding bonds.
Higher bond yields suggested that the Fed’s signal of a rate increase in December has driven investors to recalibrate their expectations on interest-rate policy. But they caution that whether the Fed pulls the trigger hinges on how the U.S. economy performs in the weeks leading to the Dec. 15-16 policy meeting.
“You are seeing a repricing of the bond market,” said John Canavan, market analyst at Stone and McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. “The Fed wants to make sure that if they hike in December, it would not be a shock to the system.”
There are other factors behind the push for higher Treasury bond yields. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks and crude oil prices rose, sapping demand for relatively safe U.S. government debt instruments.
Rising new corporate debt sales, too, sent Treasury bond yields higher as companies have been taking advantage of still-low interest rates ahead of the Fed’s tightening cycle.
In late-afternoon trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 2.219%, the highest closing level since Sept. 16, compared with 2.185% Monday.
The yield on the two-year note, highly sensitive to expected changes in the Fed’s interest-rate policy, was 0.770%, compared with 0.755% Monday.
COMMODITIES
Gasoline and diesel prices soared on reports of disruptions at the nation’s largest refined-fuel pipeline. Crude-oil prices also jumped.
News that some operations were halted along Colonial Pipeline, which stretches from Houston to Linden, N.J., propelled a rally that began earlier in the trading session on concerns about supply disruptions in Libya and Brazil.
Gasoline futures rose 7.02 cents, or 5.1%, to $1.4455 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since Aug. 31. Gasoline futures typically decline at this time of year as demand weakens, but prices have bounced in recent weeks since dropping to six-year lows in October.
Diesel futures rose 5.91 cents, or 3.9%, to $1.566 a gallon.
But both the U.S. and global oil market remain well supplied, traders said, and that fact capped price gains.
The sharp increase in fuel prices helped buoy oil prices, market participants said. Higher refined-product prices can increase demand for crude oil from refineries.
Fuel prices “really dragged the market along…with concerns about Colonial Pipeline issues,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at data provider ClipperData.
Operating company Colonial Pipeline said Tuesday that it halted operations at a facility in Houston due to flooding, limiting the delivery of diesel onto the pipeline, according to media reports. In recent days, heavy rains have led to flooding in parts of Texas.
Worries about decreased oil production in Libya and Brazil also boosted prices, pushing Brent crude, the global benchmark, above $50 a barrel for the first time since mid-October. Brent settled up $1.75, or 3.6%, to $50.54 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.
The U.S. benchmark oil price rose $1.76, or 3.8%, to $47.90 a barrel on the Nymex
In other commodity markets, gold prices fell to their lowest in a month Tuesday, with investors reluctant to bet on the precious metal ahead of U.S. employment numbers later this week.
Gold for December delivery closed down 1.9% at $1,114.14 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

       said the technology would be ready by the Japanese auto maker’s self-imposed deadline—though he wasn’t sure if it would be legal on any nation’s roads.
“We are very excited about it and we want to come as soon as possible to mass market with these technologies,” he said during the
this week. “But we cannot do it alone. Nobody can put autonomous technology out without the regulator accepting it.”
Nissan this week showed a concept electric vehicle, the Nissan IDS, with autonomous driving capabilities. While only a prototype, it gives a strong indication of what the company is planning: Nissan has developed a number of test vehicles based on its Leaf electric car that can drive themselves in city environments, handling turns and stops and navigating other traffic. The car at the show looks as though it could be a next-generation Leaf.
Autonomous driving in urban areas, which have more people, vehicles and obstacles to navigate, is seen as a greater challenge for developers. Several companies have made strides with software that handles highway navigation, but no company has set a deadline for consumer-ready autonomous city driving as soon as Nissan’s.
In a drive around Tokyo this week, a modified Nissan Leaf made its way through the city mostly without issues, using an array of 12 cameras, five conventional radar using radio waves and four laser range finders to navigate. The barely visible sensors gave a good preview of how the system might be integrated in a consumer vehicle.
Car makers globally have been hesitant to commit to deploying such technology until governments approve it and set up guidelines. However, many governments are unsure how to regulate the technology, which is still in development and could be stifled by overly constrictive rules.
Mr. Ghosn said Japan’s government has been the most supportive and proactive in the world, and it was likely that would result in it being the first country where an autonomous car would be sold. In Europe, he said, efforts to coordinate rules have been a struggle. In the U.S., some states are working on rules, but car makers would like a federal standard.
Japan, where the national government has a strong say in regulations, is touting autonomous driving technology as a potential means to reduce traffic-accident-related deaths, especially among the elderly. The country also wants to showcase its cutting-edge technologies, including autonomous driving, during the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
Nissan appears to be among the leaders in developing the technology, though many competitors are working on similar systems.



an “autopilot” function for its electric cars, but it is limited in function and primarily designed for highway driving. Nissan will introduce a similar system on some vehicles next year and a more advanced system in 2018 that handles additional functions. Other car makers, such as

  How to Host Events That Build Business

    Three consultants to financial advisers offer tips on the types of programs that deepen connections with clients—and entice them to bring friends and family along

Advisers often host events because they are hoping clients will bring friends and family who will also become clients.
But too often, advisers complain, clients show up for events alone. Some likely reasons: Clients may fear the adviser will give their friends the “hard sell,” they may feel uncomfortable discussing personal finance with friends or the program may not sound that interesting.
Here, three practice-management coaches weigh in on how advisers can increase the odds of getting clients to bring friends along and some mistakes they should avoid:

“Advisers need to focus on creating an experience, not just an event,” says Ms. Troxell, who is based in San Diego. Aim for an experience that is in some way special. These experiences should feel exclusive in that the only way the client and their friends can get access to the type of event is through the adviser’s firm, she says.
For example, for busy corporate executives, it may be better to host a family-and-friends event at a children’s museum instead of buying a luxury box at a stadium, to which executives are often invited. To make the event feel exclusive, the adviser could work with the museum staff to gain access to an area that isn’t typically open to the public or to have a private showing of a particular exhibit, she says.


Don’t steer discussions toward your work and guests’ possible needs.
“No business talk,” says Ms. Troxell, who says events should be strictly social in nature. Clients will be more likely to refer friends to you if you get to know them socially, and prospects won’t feel pressured.

Advisers should collect information about their clients (such as their hobbies) and create events that target those interests, says Mr. Ozer, who is based in Boston. For example, he says, one adviser hosted a Tesla event at which clients and their guests got to learn about the car and test drive it. He also knows of an adviser who hired a fishing expert and hosted guests at a fishing hole where they got pointers from the expert.


Don’t host only large events. Advisers can make smaller events more individualized. Another benefit of a smaller event: more time to interact with prospects, he says.

Take the long view, says Mr. Depman in Rochester, Minn. It may take years for clients to bring a friend to an event. And a prospect may attend an event (or several) but may not sign on as a client for a while. Advisers shouldn’t deem an event without an immediate payoff a failure.
“The seeds planted today may not take root for years,” he says. Clients may be busy and prospects may be simply waiting for a significant life event, such as their retirement, to call you.


Don’t be too general when you ask prospects to invite guests. “The adviser should suggest specific people to be asked to the event, not just leaving it open-ended and allowing the client to decide who bring,” Mr. Depman says. For example, if an adviser notices a client is connected on LinkedIn with an attractive prospect, the adviser may ask that client to bring that individual to the next event.

  Tesla Motors Earnings: What to Watch

    Focus will be on Model X deliveries, cash flow

third quarter financial results are expected to be released after market close on Nov. 3 with a conference call with investors at 5:30 p.m. EST.

Tesla is expected to post an adjusted net loss of 48 cents a share compared with a 2 cent a share profit in the year earlier quarter as heavy investment spending
and
in Nevada outweigh steady revenue increases.

Revenues are forecast to rise 36% to $1.26 billion in the third quarter.
rose 49% to 11,580, in line with estimates.



Tesla handed over six Model X sport-utilities on Sept. 29 and very
since then. Expect Tesla to give an update on how many vehicles will go to customers in the fourth quarter and for investors to watch that as a litmus test for how much the company has learned about launching new models. Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       has repeatedly talked about how difficult the vehicle is to build, and that may be a concern if the company struggles to ramp up volume. Getting the SUV into consumer’s hands is critical if the company hopes to meet its 2015 sales target.

Tesla raised $750 million in cash over the summer through a share sale, but it has been burning cash at an unsustainable clip due to the high costs of building factories and launching new products. Tesla had forecast it would have positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter, but difficulties launching the new SUV may have spoiled that. Look for Tesla to clarify its financial stability.

In June, Tesla CFO 



      Deepak Ahuja



       announced that he was retiring, but would stay on until a replacement was found. A replacement has still not been found.

Things may be starting to pick up in China for Tesla in terms of sales and Mr. Musk has been making statements about starting production there. Look for clarity on the status of a potential
might be in the world’s largest auto market.

Tesla has said it plans to start cell production early in 2016 in Nevada. To do that, a lot of progress must have been made in the dusty hills outside of Reno. Mr. Musk will be asked when to expect production to come online, and
Tesla is seeking new battery making partners outside of

, such as South Korea’s

At the same time, updates on the company’s new stationary battery business are due.

  NRG Chief’s Green Ambitions Are Put on Back Burner 

    Money-losing investment in renewable energy didn’t sit well with investors

Throughout its 26-year life,


has made most of its money by running big electric plants that burn fossil fuels. But six years ago, the company’s chief executive began a billion-dollar push into clean power: rooftop solar, wind farms and electric-car charging stations.
And 



      David Crane, 



       the CEO, became increasingly outspoken about the need to go green. In an essay earlier this year, Mr. Crane warned his fellow electricity executives that by failing to embrace clean energy they “are losing the hearts and minds of the future generation of Americans.”
He still believes that, he said in an interview. But he is
from the renewable-energy businesses anyway—
, he said.
“There was a mismatch between what investors wanted us to do with our cash—which was give it back—and what we wanted to do, which was put it in growth businesses,” Mr. Crane said.
In the 15 months before he decided to split off the renewable-energy businesses, the company’s shares lost about 50% of their value. The shares have dropped 25% since the new strategy was announced in mid-September.
Current investors aren’t upset about the plan to hive off the green businesses, said 



      Jonathan Arnold, 



       an equities analyst for Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. “They’re just sorry it isn’t being implemented more quickly.”
Jettisoning his green ambitions has been deflating, conceded 56-year-old Mr. Crane, who has run the Princeton, N.J., company since 2003. A Harvard-trained lawyer and former investment banker, he has become an electric-car enthusiast; he owns a Tesla Roadster, Nissan Leaf, Fisker Karma and BMW i8 sedan—electric cars.
Mr. Crane said he thought that since he tripled NRG’s fleet of conventional power plants, investors would be patient with the emerging businesses. But institutional investors had little taste for the money-losing fledgling enterprises, he said, “while no clean-energy investor would buy the conventional generation business.”
His goals now, he said, are to find a winning format for the green businesses so they survive and to restore NRG’s market value.
“Investors have lost a lot of money,” he said. “That’s not the type of CEO I’ve tried to be.”
In addition to spinning off its clean-energy businesses next year, NRG intends to cap future investments in them at $125 million. Mr. Crane is hunting for people willing to invest in his clean-energy portfolio and he said he has completed a first round of discussions with potential investors. “It’s still early days,” he said, “but there are plenty of people interested.”
Over the last decade, NRG put about $10 billion into acquisitions, mostly big power plants that sell electricity in deregulated electricity markets. The company’s generating assets are 90% conventional, meaning they use coal, natural gas or uranium, and 10% reliant on the sun or wind.
Even so, said Mr. Crane, NRG was “held out for scorn” because it invested about $1 billion in the past decade in renewable-energy ventures and in carbon-capture technology for its coal plants. Reducing carbon emissions has become a major goal as the U.S. government tries to act against climate change.
The company’s reputation with investors may also have been bruised by a selloff in investment vehicles called “yieldcos,” which it helped invent in 2012. Pioneered by NRG as well as renewable-power specialists including

and

yieldco ventures issued stock and used the proceeds to buy income-producing solar and wind projects from sponsors, freeing up capital for reinvestment. Stock in
and other companies swooned this year amid doubts about their prospects for continued dividend growth.
NRG has a long history of trying new things and then dropping them. “They’ve had a lot of ideas that haven’t worked out very well,” said 



      Toby Shea, 



       an energy analyst for Moody’s Investors Service.
As NRG returns to its roots as an independent power-generation firm, Mr. Crane sounds less than excited about a future that seems stuck on old technology. “There’s only so far you can take a coal fleet that’s 40 years old,” he said, “and facing carbon restrictions.”

  Correction: Buffalo Billion-SolarCity story

ALBANY, N.Y.  — In a story Oct. 31 about the state of New York's construction of a factory for the solar panel installation company SolarCity, The Associated Press reported erroneously the plant's production relative to SolarCity's need for panels. It will supply an undetermined portion of the demand, not 20 percent.
A corrected version of the story is below:
NY's $750M investment in SolarCity jobs not without risks
NY's $750 million investment to back solar installer SolarCity brings risks along with jobs
By GEORGE M. WALSH
Associated Press
ALBANY, N.Y.  — New York state has gone into business with a national solar energy company, committing $750 million to support California-based SolarCity in exchange for the promise of high-tech jobs in western New York and economic spinoff that reaches across the state.
But the project comes at a time of major changes and growing competition in an already competitive industry, with companies changing their business models as government subsidies that have helped sustain them are slated to start drying up next year.
And this week, shares of stock in SolarCity, which has not been profitable, were pummeled after the company on Thursday reported a net loss of $234 million during the most recent quarter and lowered expectations for growth through next year.
Time will tell if the investment promoted by Gov. Andrew Cuomo as part of his "Buffalo Billion" economic development initiative pays off, or the state is left with an empty 1 million-square-foot facility on the site of a former steel factory.
Here's a rundown of New York's deal with SolarCity:
___
THE PLAYERS
SolarCity was formed in 2006 by brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive, cousins of PayPal and Tesla entrepreneur Elon Musk, who is chairman of the company's board and its largest shareholder.
It's the biggest of several large players in the solar installation industry, concentrating mostly on residential projects but also working with commercial customers and on "utility scale" projects — large arrays of panels. It has been growing in terms of installations and revenue, yet remains unprofitable. Lyndon Rive recently told The Associated Press the state's help is critical to SolarCity's plans for the future.
"The plan is to build more factories after this one factory," he said. "It would be hard to have done it without that support."
The "Buffalo Billion" theme is a Cuomo administration creation, but the SolarCity deal was done at several arm lengths from Cuomo's office, at least on paper. Brokered by the state Economic Development Corp., the project is being jointly administered with the state university system through an arm of its Research Foundation, SUNY Polytechnic. It's modeled on the state-subsidized chip research and manufacturing complex around Albany that includes GlobalFoundries, which recently announced job cuts because of softness in the market.
___
THE DEAL
SolarCity is getting a huge, state-owned factory essentially rent-free. The deal calls for them to pay $1 dollar a year in rent — plus utilities — for 10 years in exchange for investing $5 billion in capital, operational and other expenses over that time. And the company has promised to create 1,460 high-tech jobs at the plant, 1,440 "manufacturing support and service provider jobs" and at least 2,000 other jobs in the state. Those include installation and sales crews, including the uniformed workers who buttonhole shoppers at big-box stores to drum up business. The job commitments extend for 5 years after full production begins. Rive said panels are scheduled to begin rolling off the lines in the first quarter of 2017 and reach 10,000 panels a day.
Michael Hicks, a professor of economics and director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University, said the agreement is very large and the structure is "atypical" of economic development projects. He also said the number of jobs to be generated is small given the investment.
"This is an eye-popping deal, a very questionable use of state funds, but a huge windfall for the investors of SolarCity," Hicks said.
EDC spokesman Peter Cutler defended the agreement, saying "the state is not giving a penny to SolarCity. Instead, it is paying $350 million for the future solar panel manufacturing facility and $400 million for the equipment going in it."
"The state will retain ownership of the building and the equipment it installs," he said.
___
SURE WINNERS
The first beneficiaries of the huge project are the builder, subcontractors, construction workers and suppliers working on it.
The construction deal went to LPCiminelli Inc., a large western NY company with deep political and community ties. Its chairman, Louis P. Ciminelli, has a long resume that includes time as a trustee and chairman of the New York Power Authority.
State campaign records show he and his family have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars since 2007 to local and state candidates from both major parties, including Cuomo.
The award of the construction contract by the EDC has come under scrutiny by federal authorities because of allegations the bid specifications effectively steered the work to LPCiminelli, which state officials have denied.
___
THE UPSIDE
Rive said there's plenty of demand in the market for solar panels to support the factory. He said the new plant will supply only an undetermined portion of the panels his company expects to need in 2017 and SolarCity will continue buying panels from current suppliers in countries including China and Japan. Rive also said the company expects it will need another new, larger plant in the future.
As for the stiff competition manufacturing panels that have steadily improved in technology and dropped in cost, Rive said the panels to be built in Buffalo are the most efficient in the world.
___
WHAT COULD GO WRONG
In its federal financial filings, SolarCity includes a long list of potential risks to its business, many dealing with the global economic climate and regulation that can affect any business but some particular to its industry. One of the most significant is the impending sunset of generous federal subsidies the industry has harvested with each new installation. Set to decline at the end of 2016 and go away in 2017, Rive told the AP he believes there is a "better than 50 percent chance" that Congress will restore the incentives.
Another risk is that a federal investigation of grants to the solar industry under the 2009 stimulus program could lead to government lawsuits seeking to recover possible overpayments to the industry, including SolarCity.
___
PRICE OF FAILURE
What if SolarCity ultimately can't make a go of it? Among the risks SolarCity cites in its SEC filings is the possibility it won't be able to meet its obligations to the state or otherwise be unable to continue running the plant. In that event, it says, it will have to pay the Research Foundation $41.2 million in each year it falls short, along with other potential penalties. "We believe this more than adequately protects the state's investment," Cutler said. He said the contract with SolarCity assures the payments even in the event it fails as a business.
Worst case? The state is left with 1.2 million square feet of space to fill.

  For Sony, Struggle Is Still the Bottom Line 

    Company Set to Report Fourth Annual Loss in Five Years

TOKYO—Two years after 



      Kazuo Hirai



       took over as chief executive of


, it is slipping into a familiar pattern. After telling investors that a turnaround was near, the company is set Wednesday to report its fourth annual loss in five years. Mr. Hirai and other executives will forgo their bonuses, taking up to a 50% cut in annual pay.
Consumers have moved on to brands such as


and
Electronics Co. Ratings firms have downgraded Sony's debt to junk status. And longtime Sony watchers fear Mr. Hirai is more focused on casting off its failures than on finding the hit product that could restore its reputation as one of the most innovative companies of the past century.
"Mr. Hirai delivers outward messages that are positive. But there is still the image that products that don't make money are dumped, while there is no longer-term vision for what kind of a new lifestyle Sony wants to create," said 



      Shingo Tamura, 



       a former engineer who left Sony in 2006.
Mr. Hirai, who is set to reveal Sony's long-term strategy May 22, has promised to rebuild the company's troubled electronics arm around three pillars: games, imaging technology and mobile devices.
"Sometimes at Sony, we zigzag our way to great innovations, and simply other times, we fail," he said at a Las Vegas trade show in January. "But, you know, at Sony, failure is not really an end. It's a reason. It's a reason to keep trying."
The company declined to comment for this article ahead of the earnings and strategy briefings.
Sony's new game system, the PlayStation 4, is performing well. Through early April, Sony had sold more than seven million PS4 consoles in its first five months on the market, beating

new Xbox One console.
Sony also sees promise in its high-definition portable music players, which it is selling under the Walkman name, as well as 4K television sets that offer improved picture quality. Other gadgets, such as motion sensors that can be attached to tennis rackets, are aimed at rebuilding Sony's brand.


The problem is that so far, none of the growth areas seem capable of transforming Sony's bottom line. The 4K TVs, for example, make up less than 10% of global TV sales, and it is hard for niche products to move the needle at a company with roughly $75 billion in annual revenue.
Less than two weeks ago, Sony forecast a loss of ¥130 billion ($1.3 billion) for the fiscal year that ended in March—a sharp swing from the profit of ¥30 billion that it had predicted earlier. Troubles in electronics again outweighed profits from movies and music.
Even the PlayStation isn't the cash cow it once was, because consumers are spending more time playing on smartphones. Sony's sales target of 20 million units of PlayStation hardware for the just-ended fiscal year is 45% below its level six years ago.
Sony said in February it would sell its personal-computer business and set up its TV business as a separate, though wholly owned, unit. The company is booking much of the cost of that restructuring in the just-ended year, leading some investors to say the worst might be over.
"I don't know when their next hit product will [come] or when their restructuring is going to stop, but at least they're on the right track," said 



      Arnout Van Rijn, 



       chief investment officer at Robeco Hong Kong, whose fund has been investing in Sony shares for nearly a decade. "So far it's been taking disappointingly long, but eventually that value will be there."
A viable mobile business seems like a prerequisite for success in consumer electronics, given that smartphones bundle together the roles once played by Sony products such as the PlayStation, the Walkman and Cyber-shot cameras.
In 2012, the year Mr. Hirai became CEO, Sony made progress toward his goal of establishing the company as a clear No. 3 in smartphones, behind Samsung of South Korea and Apple of the U.S. Helped by strength in Japan and Europe, where Sony still benefits from the legacy of a defunct partnership with
of Sweden, Sony's global market share rose to 4.3% in 2012, according to IDC, a research firm.
Last year, Sony slipped back to 3.8% and stood in sixth place. While the company's Xperia smartphones have received favorable reviews, consumers see few compelling reasons to trade in their iPhones or Galaxy handsets. Inexpensive Chinese handsets control the low end of the market, and in the U.S., Sony lacks strong relationships with mobile carriers.
The company has said it won't pursue market volume and be dragged into price competition on smartphones, although it has released less-expensive models for emerging markets.
Sony has had more success with one of the key components of smartphones: the built-in cameras. Sensors made by Sony are used in iPhones and a number of other smartphones. That buttressed one of Mr. Hirai's three growth pillars, the company's imaging business.
Yet even the sensor business faces challenges. Samsung, which previously used Sony sensors in its flagship phones, turned to in-house imaging technology for its current top-of-the-line handset, the Galaxy S5.
Many of the questions about Sony's future center on its identity as a consumer-electronics company. Its profit today largely comes from disparate businesses such as Hollywood movies, recorded music and a bank and life-insurance unit in Japan. Adding to the impression of disjointedness, Sony said in April that it would invest $2 million to start a real-estate brokerage in Japan.
Other Japanese technology companies such as

,

and

had big parts-making operations and industrial businesses to fall back on when their consumer businesses ran into trouble. All three posted profits for the just-ended fiscal year.
Panasonic generates about three-quarters of its revenue from sales to other businesses—supplying batteries to the electric-car maker

of the U.S., for example. By contrast, only about 10% of Sony's revenue comes from sales to other businesses, according to 



      Atul Goyal, 



       an analyst at Jefferies.
Some analysts say Sony should follow in Panasonic's path and get out of TV sets and other commodity consumer goods dominated by China and South Korea. Others say the secret is to marry Sony's hardware expertise with new software and services, such as a cloud-based television service Sony plans in the U.S. this year.
"Of course it's nice to have better and better audio and video, but unless it's part of an ecosystem it has no purpose. It's destined to be commoditized," said 



      Koichiro Tsujino, 



       a longtime Sony executive who left in 2006 for

and now runs a Japanese Internet company, Alex Corp.

  Toyota's RAV4 EV Supply Pact With Tesla to Expire in 2014

    Expiration of Battery Pack Agreement Puts in Question Whether Automaker Will Continue With RAV4 Electric Vehicle

supply agreement with


for the battery pack in the RAV4 electric vehicle will expire in 2014, putting in question whether Toyota will continue with the lightly-selling utility.
Toyota sells the RAV4 primarily in California with a base price of $49,800. The agreement calls for Toyota buying the powertrains and batteries for about 2,500 RAV4 EVs from Tesla. The 41.8 kilowatt-hour battery pack on the RAV4 gives it an EPA rated range of 103 miles, the second-longest all-electric range of any vehicle on the market behind Tesla's own Model S.
Toyota and Tesla struck the agreement not long after 



      Akio Toyoda, 



       the chief executive officer of Toyota, agreed to invest $50 million in Tesla.
Tesla said last week
that it expects the supply arrangement to end this year.
In a statement, Toyota said: "As was the arrangement, battery-supply to the current model RAV4 will conclude this year when we reach the originally planned number vehicles. We don't have anything to report on future product plans. But we will continue to maintain a good relationship with Tesla and to evaluate the feasibility of working together on future collaborations."

  Most Stocks Drop But Dow Ekes Out Gains

    Rising Market Volatility Makes Investors Cautious

The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher Thursday, but most stocks slipped in a choppy session that saw the broader market give back early gains.
The Dow gained 32.43 points, or 0.2%, to end at 16550.97, but had climbed as many as 104 points during the session. The blue-chip benchmark failed to top its April 30 record closing high of 16580.84.
The S&P 500 fell 2.58 points, or 0.1%, to 1875.63, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 16.18 points, or 0.4%, to 4051.50, ending at a three-week low.
Shares of many large, dividend-paying companies advanced on Thursday, while smaller, riskier stocks lost ground, a replay of action seen in recent weeks. The Russell 2000 Index of small company shares fell 1%.
Even with the Dow near a record, investors have voiced caution about committing money to the market in recent days amid rising volatility.
"The equity market seems to be stuck in this range," said 



      Andres Garcia-Amaya, 



       global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. Investors are "waiting for the confirmation that the economic data is improving and sustaining."
Data on Thursday showed that initial claims for jobless benefits during the latest week fell by 26,000 to 319,000, versus expectations of 325,000.
Turbulence in previously strong-performing Internet and biotechnology sectors in recent weeks has inflicted deep losses for many investors, keeping many on the defensive, traders said.

  Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks End Mostly Lower

MARKETS AT A GLANCE
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT
Stocks finished mostly lower in a choppy session, while Treasurys ended mostly higher. The euro weakened against the dollar on comments from ECB's Draghi, while the dollar weakened against the yen on remarks from Fed's Yellen. Oil and gold edged lower.
OPENING CALL
Chinese inflation data are on tap Friday. After March's consumer inflation was weaker than expected, it will be interesting to see if the CPI stabilizes in April. Perhaps more concerning is the PPI, which has been stuck in a deflationary state for more than two years. Market watchers in Asia will also be keeping an eye on an interest-rate decision from the Bank of Korea as well as the Reserve Bank of Australia's quarterly policy statement, which will contain an updated outlook for growth and inflation.
EQUITIES
The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher, but most stocks slipped in a choppy session that saw the broader market give back early gains.
Shares of many large, dividend-paying companies advanced, while smaller, riskier stocks lost ground, a replay of action seen in recent weeks.

Priceline Group fell 2.1% after the online travel-booking site reported first-quarter earnings that rose above forecasts, but provided a downbeat outlook for the current quarter.
Ford Motor rose 2.3% after the auto maker said it would buy back up to 116 million shares, equivalent to about $1.8 billion.
In Asian trading Thursday, Japanese stocks picked up from sharp losses the previous session, while Hong Kong stocks also rose after better-than-expected export numbers from China.
FOREX
The euro fell against the dollar after the European Central Bank signaled that it could reduce interest rates or take other measures to battle low inflation in the euro zone as early as its June meeting.
ECB President Mario Draghi, speaking in a news conference, said the central bank would be willing to take action at its next meeting to ward off deflation in the euro zone.
The euro moved markedly lower against the dollar on Mr. Draghi's words, after trading just below $1.40 beforehand, but investors say the outlook for the euro-dollar pair is unchanged. The market will need to see the ECB take steps to ward off deflation for euro-dollar to break out of its trading range of between $1.35 to $1.40, or before investors alter their outlook for the common currency.
Also during Thursday's session, the dollar fell against the yen and other major currencies after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen reiterated for a second day that interest rates will remain low for an extended period.
BONDS
Treasury bonds rose as two of the world's top central bankers reassured investors that interest rates will stay low in the foreseeable future to support the economy.
The 30-year bond was the only loser in the U.S. government debt market, after a weak auction sent its price down.
The European Central Bank held its key interest rate at a record low of 0.25%. ECB President Mario Draghi said the bank is comfortable to act next month if needed. Economists have said the central bank needs to take action to prevent deflation, or a persistent decline in consumer prices that would crimp consumer and business spending.
In her second day of testimony on Capitol Hill, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said that interest rates are unlikely to rise unless the U.S. economic recovery is strong. The comments came one day after Ms. Yellen suggested the U.S. central bank will continue to hold its interest rates near zero for a considerable time to support the economy.
"With both the Fed and ECB indicating that they will stay accommodative for longer, that is in response to weak economic numbers and below trend inflation which are both good for bonds," said Larry Milstein, head of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich in New York.
COMMODITIES
Oil futures slipped as traders who had bet on higher prices locked in their profits after Wednesday's rally.
U.S. prices closed above $100 a barrel but erased Wednesday's 1.3% gain, as traders cashed in their profits from the previous day.
Prices climbed Wednesday after a government report showed U.S. oil supplies fell last week, contrary to analyst expectations that stocks would rise to a new record high. Still, inventories remain near their highest levels, according to weekly U.S. Energy Information Administration data going back to 1982.
"We got a little bit more exited yesterday, I think. Today, cooler heads prevailed," said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Market participants "realized there is a lot of oil out there," he said.
Gold prices settled slightly lower after shuffling between gains and losses, as investors weighed continued tensions in Ukraine against a resurgent U.S. recovery that threatens to sap demand for the safe-haven metal.

  Big Japanese Companies Remain Ready to Spend

    Fujitsu Aims to Increase Capital Investment 19%; Panasonic Plans 18% Rise

TOKYO—Some big Japanese companies are proposing ambitious investment plans for the year ahead, suggesting growth prospects have a chance to stay on track despite cautious signs on earnings.
Most Japanese companies run on a fiscal year that ends in March, and this past week dozens of them reported last fiscal-year's earnings and this year's outlook.
The bad news: Last year's profit surges aren't likely to be repeated, partly because a one-time windfall brought by a weaker yen has ended.
The better news: Companies are still investing in longer-term growth.



plans about $1.4 billion in capital investment this year, up 19% from a year earlier and the highest in seven years. For years, the company had to shrink its semiconductor operations in response to severe price pressures, but now it is mostly finished with the overhaul and ready to invest in data centers serving Japanese customers. "Fiscal 2014 is the year we're shifting to medium- and long-term growth," said Fujitsu President 



      Masami Yamamoto.



projected 18% growth in capital investment over last year, the bulk of which would be allocated to auto-related businesses such as lithium-ion batteries. The company recently signed a letter of intent to participate in the construction of Tesla Motor Inc.'s battery plant in the U.S.
A pickup in corporate spending is essential to Prime Minister 



      Shinzo Abe's



       growth strategy. He wants to break Japan's longstanding destructive spiral in which falling prices and wages contribute to weak corporate investment, and vice versa.
This year is putting Mr. Abe's plans to the test, in part because the yen is no longer falling and also because he chose to go ahead with a national sales-tax increase to 8% from 5%, effective April 1. A Bank of Japan survey in March found big companies planned to raise investment just 0.1% in the current fiscal year.
More recently, though, car makers, department stores and other retailers have begun to suggest the falloff in consumer demand from the tax increase has been less severe than expected, meaning profits might hold up.
"As earnings go up, capital spending will go up with some delay. This fact will hold going forward," said 



      Ernst Glanzmann, 



       a portfolio manager at Swiss Global Asset Management who manages about $806 million in Japanese equities.
Other investors are less sanguine, fearing that an expected revenue decline this year might cast a chill over the entire economy.
The Nikkei Stock Average fell nearly 3% on Wednesday after some disappointing corporate reports, before recovering a bit on Thursday and Friday. Some foreign investors say they don't expect further stock-market-boosting moves coming from Mr. Abe's government.
"What we are seeing now is a bit of disappointment because the pace of change is slower than what we would like it to be. But we think the big story is that the corporate sector is in good health," said 



      Jeffrey Atherton, 



       a senior portfolio manager at London-based GLG, who manages about $10 billion in Japanese equities.
For the year ended in March, companies listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange posted revenue growth of 13% and a rise in operating profit of 43%, according to data compiled by SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. as of Thursday. This year, companies expect operating profit to rise just 7.6% and revenue to drop 0.7%.
At


, the weak yen helped operating profit surge to a record $23 billion last fiscal year, but in the current year it expects that figure to rise just 0.3%. Toyota is raising its capital investments by just under 2% to around $10 billion.
"So far, there seem to be more downward surprises" on earnings, said 



      Arnout Van Rijn, 



       chief investment officer at Robeco Hong Kong. Mr. Van Rijn, who manages about €1 billion ($1.4 billion) in Japanese equities, said he remains bullish and believes some executives are being too conservative in their forecasts.
That was underscored by


executive 



      Makoto Kubo, 



       who suggested the electronics company might not stick to its cautious forecast for long. Toshiba forecast a 14% rise in operating profit to a record of nearly $3.3 billion, a target that was about 7% below market expectations. "This is our bottom-line commitment. We will aim for an all-time high for sure and we hope to revise upward as we get the results," Mr. Kubo said.

  'How to Make It' in California

Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who's been given red-carpet treatment by California politicians, is starting to grumble about the state's business climate. Asked this week why California wasn't among the electric car-maker's top choices for its new $4 billion battery factory, the Silicon Valley billionaire replied, "Other states have a much more streamlined approach," adding that "we can't afford to wait a year or more for permits to proceed."
Maybe so, but the truth is that Mr. Musk is just panhandling for more special favors. Earlier this year, Tesla identified Arizona, Texas, Nevada and New Mexico as candidates for its planned "giga-factory," which the company says will employ 6,500 workers. However, Tesla expanded the field to California after Gov. Jerry Brown offered to sweeten up the deal with economic incentives. Mr. Brown would face no greater humiliation than if Tesla—California's iconic "green" business—were to push into Texas, especially in light of all the subsidies the state has lavished on the company.
For starters, electric-car buyers in California receive a $2,500 rebate (on top of the $7,500 federal tax credit). Tesla has also been exempted from state sales tax on its manufacturing equipment, which has saved the company $90 million. But most important are the zero-emission-vehicle (ZEV) credits needed to comply with California's electric-car mandate, which Tesla has cashed in for $165 million.
Tesla's windfall from hawking its surplus credits to other automakers dried up this year because other manufacturers have ramped up their electric-car production. Some manufacturers also bought excess credits that they are now banking. Hence, Tesla on Wednesday reported a $50 million loss for the first quarter this year.
Mr. Musk attributed the loss to increased investment, but the company has been operating in the red for the past year (based on generally accepted accounting principles). The last and only time Tesla posted a profit ($11 million) was the first quarter of 2013, when it earned $68 million from ZEV credit sales.
In any case, Tesla is still raking in tens of millions from selling regulatory credits to comply with federal greenhouse gas emissions standards and may get another boost once California's ZEV mandate ratchets up in 2017. But in the meantime, Tesla will have to keep a close eye on its costs, which explains why it's looking to build its new factory outside of California.
Mr. Musk would no doubt like to keep the plant in California, which would significantly reduce the costs of transporting the batteries to Tesla's manufacturing site in Fremont. But the question is how high a price Mr. Brown is willing to pay Tesla for the factory, and whether the subsidies would outweigh California's "lots of little burdens and regulations and taxes," to appropriate the governor's off-the-cuff remarks last week.
Mr. Brown also slipped that "smart people figure out how to make it" in California. What he meant was that they figure out how to milk it.

  Mercedes B-Class Hits the A-List of Electric Cars

    The Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive shines as a completely on-point premium family electric that braids Tesla's and Mercedes' DNA very well

in the Appliance Department you'll now find the Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive, the firm's first proper, volume-production electric car: Five-seats, five doors, front-wheel drive, 85 miles of range, 42 grand or so before tax credits at the state and federal level. In all respects, just another ship in Mercedes' fleet.
First impression: The B-ED reeks of the same high-class domesticity as Mercedes' R-Class and M-Class breeders. Similar seats, same spill-resistant textures, mostly the same instruments and switchgear, including the knobby dealy in the center console to dial in navi, audio and vehicle systems. Love it or hate it, there, too, is Mercedes' 7-inch color display floating above ball vents in the dash center, looking like an abandoned iPad.
In any event, the B-ED is not weird. Actually, it couldn't be more familiar and obvious. The accelerator pedal might as well have "Schnell" written on it.
Got kids? Got a garage? Commute to the train station? Don't want to have to park a big German blimp every time you go out? Believe me, if your first Mercedes had a plug, you wouldn't be missing a thing.
Redesigned in 2011, the B-Class (tall family wagon) has been unavailable in the U.S. (but yes for Mexico and Canada). As part of the platform redesign, different versions of the vehicle floor stampings were created to accommodate batteries or compressed natural-gas storage. The B will be available in the States only as an EV. That fact, it's fair to say, won't supercharge model sales.
Mercedes execs are realistic. When I asked project manager Anton Sonntag how many he thought the company could sell, he shrugged and said: "As many as people will buy."
The B-ED is, realists would note, a "compliance car." The phrase refers to a low- or zero-emission vehicle model, built in whatever numbers necessary to satisfy some portion of California's clean-vehicle quota and typically sold only in California and 10 other clean-air states. The California Air Resources Board obliges major manufacturers to sell an incrementally rising percentage of advanced technology ZEV cars even if, and most assuredly when, they lose money on them.

While it emerged out of a crass effort at compliance, the B-ED shines, an on-point premium family electric vehicle.

Compliance cars put something of a strain on auto makers' communications departments, because the unspoken truth is so, um, unspeakable. So let's divide the B-ED's media debut last week in Silicon Valley into text and subtext. The subtext was regulatory compliance, and of a very expedient variety, too: Rather than rely on in-house R&D, Mercedes essentially contracted with Tesla—the Silicon Valley car maker and acknowledged leader in electric automobiles—to provide the EV architecture (motor, transmission, battery, power electronics) for its electron-fired B-Class.
The B-Class ED is the product of a technology-sharing alliance between Tesla and Daimler that goes back to Mercedes' 2009 investment. Tesla will make the B-Class battery pack, power management system and thrashy bits at the factory in Fremont, Calif., and ship them to Germany for final vehicle assembly.
Typically with advanced technology/compliance car projects—oh, the Honda Fit EV, for example—the manufacturer will convert an existing vehicle into an EV or plug-in EV, as cost effectively as possible. Then it will make, lease and sell as many units as it takes, at whatever price, to hit the company's compliance targets. Then, God willing, it will shut up about it, because each unit sold loses money. When these cars come up in conversation, auto executives start looking at their shoes.
But, from my tour of California's electric-car culture two weeks ago, I can tell you that is changing. As a class, these vehicles have fully outgrown whatever technical adolescence made them awkward in the first decade of this century. I've driven a gas-powered B-Class in Europe, and the Tesla-powered version is massively better.
One of these days, one of these compliance cars is going to break out, sales-wise. The B-Class ED, which will sell in all 50 states, could be the one. While it might have emerged out of a crass effort at compliance, the B-ED just shines, a completely on-point premium family electric that braids Tesla's and Mercedes' DNA so convincingly the car might as well be called the Model B.

$41,450

: Battery-electric, with a AC permanent magnet synchronous motor, 28 kwh lithium-ion battery, front-wheel drive

177 hp/252 pound-feet or torque

171.6 inches/3,924 pounds

106.3 inches

7.9 seconds

85 miles (EPA)

12.25 cubic feet
The drive parts are Tesla's devising, including a 28 kwh lithium battery pack and power-management system. An electric motor rated at 132 kW, or 177 horsepower, and 251 pound-feet of torque, drive the front wheels through a single-ratio transmission. That is enough twist to pull the 3,924-pound vehicle to 60 mph in less than 8 seconds, while top speed is limited to 100 mph. Among its curiosities is the car's four levels of regenerative braking, accessed through the steering wheel-mounted paddles. On the most aggressive setting, the car slows crisply when you lift your foot off the accelerator, but it doesn't have the one-pedal operation of its rival, BMW i3.
The B-ED doesn't have supercharging capacity. With a 220V/40A Level 2 charger, it takes 3.5 hours to fully charge a depleted battery, says Mercedes, and 2 hours to raise levels to 60%.
Throughout my 50-mile test drive in the Bay area, the B-ED had great spirit under the spur. And due to its low center of gravity—the dense battery pack buried in the floor—the B-ED rides well and corners with a lot more confidence than its gas-powered twin, even though the electric weighs 700 pounds more.
Speaking of weight: The steel-bodied B-ED competes directly with BMW's new and radical, carbon-fiber and plastic-bodied BMW i3. Both are next-generation electric family cars priced in the low $40,000s, and both have roughly the same range, power and comparable performance. And yet the two cars are wildly different, reflecting the industrial strategies behind them. The BMW's advanced-materials approach to weight saving netted them a car weighing a mere 2,860 pounds, fully 1,064 pounds lighter than the B-ED.
The Mercedes' approach is more conservative, fiscally and technically. And we'll have to wait to see the comparative results. These are amazing, uncertain times in appliance sales.

  Tesla Reports Loss on Higher Research Costs

    Expenses at Luxury Car Maker Rise Ahead of Launch of New Sports-Utility Vehicles

shares fell in after-market trading Wednesday after the Silicon Valley electric-car maker reported a net loss of $49.8 million for the first quarter, reflecting a surge in costs associated with expanding its product lineup and customer-service operations and launching a huge new battery factory.
Tesla Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       disclosed during a conference call after the close of New York stock trading Wednesday that Panasonic Corp., manufacturer of the batteries used in his company's luxury electric cars, has signed a letter of intent to participate in construction of what he calls the
for assembling vehicle batteries in the U.S.
Mr. Musk said Tesla plans to break ground on the first potential site for the factory next month, and start work on preparing a second possible site soon after. Tesla plans to start work on multiple sites as a hedge against regulatory or other delays. The company aims to start battery production by 2017, and Mr. Musk said he's confident of achieving a 30% reduction in battery costs per kilowatt hour.
Panasonic would be the only battery company producing cells in the factory, which is proposed to be 10 million square feet and cost as much as $5 billion, Mr. Musk said.
Panasonic, in a statement, confirmed that it has signed a letter of intent with Tesla. "The two companies have signed a letter of intent and are further deepening the level of their discussions on details of gigafactory collaboration," said Jim Reilly, a spokesman for Panasonic in the U.S.
Mr. Musk also disclosed that California "is back in the running" as a site for the factory. Previously California was off the list, he said, because of the "complex and lengthy" process of obtaining permits. Tesla plans to begin breaking ground on the first of two finalist sites in June, then a second site a few weeks later. Tesla is also looking at sites in Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Arizona.
Mr. Musk's optimistic comments about his battery-factory project came after investors had sent the company's share price down more than 6% in after-market trading following the release of Tesla's first-quarter financial results.
The company forecast rising costs for vehicle engineering, new plants and other expansion moves that may have spooked investors, along with a forecast of another net loss in the second quarter. Tesla said capital spending exceeded operating cash flow by $80.7 million in the first quarter.
The Silicon Valley electric-luxury-car maker said it produced 7,535 Model S sedans in the January to March quarter, slightly more than its earlier forecast. Revenue for the latest quarter was $620.5 million, up 10% from a year earlier, but up less than 1% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Net orders for Model S sedans in North America grew by 10% from the fourth quarter, the company said. Model S deliveries in the U.S. fell, however, as more cars were shipped overseas.
The company forecast a marginal profit for the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis.
Research and development costs rose to $81.5 million in the latest quarter from $54.9 million a year ago. The company said it expects R&D expenses for the second quarter to grow by 30% from the first quarter. Much of that expense is related to development of the company's Model X sport-utility vehicle, which Tesla said would launch in the second quarter of 2015, a delay from earlier estimates of late this year or early next year.
Tesla raised $2.3 billion through convertible bond offerings in the first quarter, in part, to contribute toward building the battery factory, capable of making hundreds of thousands of battery packs for its vehicles.
Mr. Musk said he is optimistic about the prospects for Tesla in China, the world's largest car market. "I don't think we've got any kind of a demand challenge in China," he said, adding he's instructed employees working in the country to "spend money as fast as they can spend it without wasting it."Tesla is looking into building its vehicles in China within three or four years, he said, and could also build vehicles in Europe as sales expand.
Tesla said its automotive gross margins, measured on a non-GAAP basis, would increase slightly in the second quarter from the 25.4% reported for the first quarter. The company said a 28% automotive gross margin "is still an achievable target" by the fourth quarter. Analysts study this measure closely because it points to the efficiency and profitability of making and selling vehicles, during a period when heavy investment in research and development and capital lower overall margins.
Tesla said it plans to invest $650 million to $850 million in capital expenditures for the year to boost production, expand its service and charging networks, launch new models and start work on its battery factory.
The company said it is growing its internal production capability to meet growing demand for its Model S. Production is now at almost more than 700 vehicles a week, up 15% from its weekly production rate at the end of the fourth quarter. By the end of 2014, Tesla expects the production rate to rise to 1,000 vehicles a week.
Tesla's results, again, were dented by stock-based compensation for executives. Tesla said the share costs amounted to $37 million—or 30 cents a share. Other costs it subtracted in its accounting were non-cash expenses related to its convertible note and deferred profit related to lease accounting.

  Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks Rise Broadly

MARKETS AT A GLANCE
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT
U.S. stocks rose in a broad rally, with the Dow industrials and S&P 500 closing at fresh highs, while Treasurys fell. The yen fell against other major currencies as gains in global stock markets sapped demand for safe assets. A deteriorating situation is Ukraine sent gold and oil prices higher.
OPENING CALL
In Australia, Prime Minister Tony Abbott's government will release its first federal budget Tuesday, while China will publish industrial-production data and retail-sales figures for April. April's data suite will shed further light on whether the weakness early this year was related to the Lunar New Year holiday and the harsh winter weather in the U.S., or whether it was indicative of a more fundamental economic downshift. Meanwhile, financial markets are closed for a holiday Tuesday in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia.
EQUITIES
The Dow industrials and the S&P 500 advanced to all-time highs in a broad rally that also lifted beaten-down technology stocks and shares of smaller companies.
"It's the sectors and names that have gotten beaten up the most that are coming back the most," said Reed Choate, a portfolio manager at the New York money manager Neville, Rodie & Shaw, which manages $1.4 billion.
Mr. Choate says he has recently been surveying the landscape of high-growth stocks that have pulled back sharply recently in search of attractively priced companies to start investing in again. "You start rolling up your sleeves and doing deep dives to see which are sound companies," he said.
Monday's rally came on the back of little news and relatively light trading volumes. Wall Street trading desks said the gains were driven largely by hedge funds piling back into stocks that have sold off this year--likely reversing bearish positions they took earlier this year--rather than by big investors placing fresh bets on the market's future direction. "That's been a theme for the past several weeks. The long-only community has been extremely passive and quiet," said David Seaburg, head of equity sales trading at brokerage Cowen and Co., referring to big mutual funds that buy and hold large amounts of stock.
Some of the hardest-hit and consumer Internet stocks rebounded.
Twitter rallied 5.9%, after slumping 18% last week. Amazon gained 3.6% and Facebook rose 4.5%.
Corporate news flow was light, but included more deal news.
Pinnacle Foods surged 13.2% after agreeing to be acquired by Hillshire Brands for roughly $4.3 billion in cash and stock. Hillshire's stock retreated 3.2%.
Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, which oversees $357 billion, said a combination of better-than-expected quarterly earnings and improving economic data should pave the way for further gains in stocks in the near term.
"By and large the data's been pretty good on the U.S. economy," Mr. Paulsen said. "There's a lot of momentum here. We were put off by the weather but as that starts to dissipate, you're starting to see [improvement] coming back through."
First-quarter earnings have largely come in better than expected, though the pace of earnings growth has slowed. Nearly 91% of companies in the S&P 500 index have reported earnings, according to FactSet, with profits on track to grow 2.2% over last year. Analysts had expected a drop in first-quarter profits of 1.1% as recently as late March.
In Asian trading Monday, Mumbai shares hit a new high on hopes the Indian election will bring in a more business-friendly government, while Chinese stocks rose as the market welcomed a blueprint for capital-market reform. Japan's Nikkei ended modestly lower.
FOREX
The yen fell against other major currencies as gains in global stock markets sapped demand for safe assets.
The Japanese currency also lost ground as a sharp decline in Japan's exports prompted worries that the government's next move to boost its economy would include measures that would weaken the yen.
Investors shifted to riskier assets, boosting stock markets around the world while selling down the yen and U.S. bonds. Some investors perceive the yen as a haven of stability amid economic and political uncertainty.
The selloff in Treasurys pushed bond yields higher, making the dollar more attractive to Japanese investors, said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at the currency brokerage Commonwealth Foreign Exchange.
BONDS
Treasury bonds pulled back as higher global stocks sapped demand for safe assets.
Monday's bond-price weakness followed last week's decline. Bond investors have been cashing out after the yield on the benchmark 10-year note hit a six-month low, reflecting a view the recent price rally is overdone.
"We're going through some low-yield fatigue at the moment," said Dan Mulholland, head of U.S. Treasury trading at BNY Mellon Capital Markets.
On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index hit an intraday record high. Investors' appetites for riskier assets got a boost from China's new blueprint for capital-market overhauls aimed at boosting regulatory transparency and widening market access.
The news, released by China's cabinet at the end of last week, overshadowed concerns about Ukraine. Pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine declared victory in Sunday's secession referendum, ratcheting up tensions between the West and Moscow. The West and Ukraine's government say the referendum is illegitimate.
COMMODITIES
Gold prices rose, a day after pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine declared victory in a succession referendum, raising chances that rival factions will split the country in two.
"As long as Ukraine is headline news, gold will have a fair value of around $1,300," said James Cordier, a principal at Liberty Trading. "Once that support is gone, it should drift to around $1,250," he said, a level last seen in February.
In other markets, platinum prices rose nearly 1%, after attempts to get South Africa's strike-ridden mines operating again were met by bloodshed.
Oil futures rose on concerns that the West could impose sanctions on Russia's energy sector in response to the deteriorating situation in Ukraine.
A supply disruption is a "low-probability event, but it's not a zero-probability event," said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. "I think it's a very legitimate concern."

  GM Offers Cadillac Dealers $5,000 to Promote Test Drives of Plug-In ELR

    Customer Discount Certificates Will Knock $3,000 off  Lease or Purchase Price

is offering Cadillac dealers $5,000 to push test drives of its ELR plug-in hybrid and arming them with customer discount certificates that can knock $3,000 off the lease or purchase price.
The offer—dubbed the Demonstrator Allowance Program—comes as ELR inventories continue to grow. GM had 1,688 of the models in stock at the end of April or a 719-day supply, according to Autodata Corp. That means if the auto maker stopped producing the ELR now, it would take almost two years to sell the current models.
The ELR sports coupe went on sale in late December with a starting price of $75,000. The car was aimed at giving customers a luxury option. It also travels about 40 miles on electricity before switching to gasoline—the same as the Chevrolet Volt.
Industry analysts quickly criticized the pricing since customers interested in an electric vehicle could either purchase the cheaper Volt, which starts at $35,000, or opt to spend a little more for the Tesla Model S from

GM cut the price of the Volt last year to make it more competitive.
GM had an 88-day supply of the Volt at the end of last month. The company sold 5,154 Volts from January through April, down 7% from the prior-year period. The company had sold at total of 241 Cadillac ELRs through the end of April.
The promotion is part of a nationwide effort to get more dealers to back and support test drives, Cadillac spokesman 



      David Caldwell



       said. Cadillac has found success in providing test drives at mobile sites in California. This offer now allows dealers to participate.
"For many drivers, electrification is still foreign to them," Mr. Caldwell said. "The program gives dealers the freedom to give customers that experience. This [a plug-in hybrid] is also a different idea around our brand and we need to take our time with this. We are still in the early days."
While customers get the discount, it is the dealers that can make some serious money on the deal.
The demonstrator allowance programs promises $5,000 for each ELR designated as a test vehicle between May 1 and June 2. Each vehicle must accumulate a minimum of 750 miles from test drives, which must be logged by the dealer.
Dealers who have fewer than seven unused ELR models in stock can designate one for the demonstrator program. Those who have more can put two ELRs in the program helping them collect $10,000. Dealers can collect an additional $2,000 for every ELR they sell in July and an extra $1,000 for every one sold in August.

  BMW's Carbon Fiber Could Test Tesla

isn't afraid to take a detour. The German auto maker will next month launch the i8, a plug-in hybrid sports car which could give

' Model S a run for its money.
Besides being a potential new driver for BMW's stock, the i8 represents a broader trend in the old car industry's efforts to refit itself for the modern age. That, more than one individual model, spells trouble for Tesla.
BMW's new car, made out of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic, is part an effort that has cost €750 million ($1.03 billion) so far to develop lighter, more powerful electric vehicles.
Vehicles such as the i8 and the lower-cost i3 electric compact could be more important to BMW than investors seem to think. First, they can open up new markets: Almost 70% of customers for the new i brand have never owned a BMW, according to ISI Group. The two i-brand models will likely straddle Tesla's Model S in terms of price and spec, suggesting the German auto maker could pick up at least some sales from its U.S. rival, notes


Production could become meaningful quickly, thanks in part to the relatively simple manufacturing system that gets new models to market in about two years. BMW could increase production of i cars to 300,000 annually over the next five years, up from 23,200 this year, estimates ISI Group. Assuming an average selling price of €35,000—the i3's starting price—and a 15% margin, these would generate €1.6 billion of operating profit. That is equivalent to roughly one-fifth of forecast operating profit for the company this year.
The potential for using carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic, which is half the weight of steel, on BMW's wider fleet remains tough to gauge. While BMW says it will use the material, the cost, at several times that of steel, looks hard to swallow for now.
Yet BMW's stock doesn't seem to reflect much excitement about these efforts. At just under 10 times 2015 earnings per share, it trades in line with German rival
and not far above

Investors may be pricing the option value on BMW's research spending too cheaply.
The flip side of this concerns Tesla, whose stock trades at more than 55 times estimated 2015 earnings. Tesla has developed highly lauded premium vehicles that are forcing older competitors to raise their game—not only BMW but also, for example, Ford with its new truck incorporating more aluminum.
A Tesla driver probably wouldn't be caught dead in an F-150, using more aluminum or otherwise. The point, though, is that the company's stock is predicated on rapid sales growth, and Tesla is a relative newcomer going up against large, established rivals. And the latter are, more and more, taking up Tesla's challenge—and crowding the road ahead of it.

The selloff began abruptly in early March, with traders saying there was no single reason sparking the collapse. The losses have been concentrated in what had been the market's hottest names, particularly Internet, social-media and biotech stocks.
Money managers say it is no mystery what has been at work: These stocks rose to stratospheric prices compared with their earnings outlooks, driven by so-called momentum traders such as hedge funds that pile into rising shares. But these firms were equally quick to hit the sell button.
Now, many investors say valuations are still so rich that further declines are still in store. Tesla trades at 89 times next year's earnings, according to FactSet. That is down from a price-to-earnings multiple of 117 in March, but still about six times as expensive as the S&P 500. Daily-deals site

trades at 35 times next year's earnings.
"We've gone from three times silly to two times silly," said 



      Mitch Rubin, 



       chief investment officer at RiverPark Funds, which has $3.1 billion under management. As investors start focusing more on the fundamentals of these stocks, they could easily fall further, he said. "When the facts start to matter for these stocks, the bottom is a long way off."
Mr. Rubin has been betting that shares of

and Twitter would fall. Just last week, he placed bets that some stocks already down 40% would extend their slide, he said.
Riskier corners of the market have taken a bruising. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks last week briefly dropped 10% from its recent peak. The Russell 2000 Growth index, home to many of the small fast-growing companies that have taken a hit lately, is down 7.1% so far this year.
But broader indexes have weathered the storm. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Friday at a record, its second of the year. The Russell 1000 Value Index, which tracks large stocks that generally grow at a slow pace and pay dividends, is up 2.8% this year.
Behind the rally that lifted these momentum stocks to lofty valuations was a hunger among investors for fast earnings growth at a time when the global economy is stuck in slow motion. S&P 500 companies are on pace to report first-quarter profits that are 2.2% higher than they were a year ago, according to FactSet.
"The challenge these stocks are going to face is who is the buyer here that steps in now that the bloom is off the rose," said Michael Church, president of Philadelphia-based Addison Capital, which has about $550 million under management.
The declines in these momentum stocks have been sharp and swift. Twitter slumped 21% over a two-day span last week after the expiration of a lockup period that prevented the company's early investors and employees from selling shares.
The company still trades at 285 times next year's forecast earnings. While that is down from a price-to-earnings ratio of 1,154 in early March, it is still considerably more than the S&P 500, which trades at 15.2 times coming earnings, FactSet says.
"You can't go to 



      Warren Buffett



       and say, 'Buy Twitter, it's cheap,'" said 



      Seth Setrakian, 



       co-head of domestic equities at brokerage firm First New York Securities. "He'd slap you."
To be sure, some buyers are stepping in on some of these beaten-down stocks. 



      Jamie Cox, 



       managing partner at Harris Financial Group, a financial-services firm in Richmond, Va., that manages money primarily for retirees, said he took a small position in Twitter days after the company's quarterly report on April 29.
"I could never justify Twitter in the $70s, but I could justify buying the stock at these levels," he said. "It's ok to overpay for it right now because the potential for what it can do is worth the chance."


Other stocks are also stuck in this purgatory.

trades at a multiple of 74 times next year's expected earnings,

at 63.3 and

at 36.5, according to FactSet.
Amazon has traded at high valuations for years, as investors credited the firm for its practice of investing its money in warehouses and computer power instead of booking profits.
But Amazon investors have been rethinking that premise in the wake of the last two earnings reports, which showed strong revenue growth and skimpy earnings. After peaking above $400 in January, the stock has lost 28%.
John Thompson, 



       founder and chief executive of Chicago hedge fund Vilas Capital Mangement LLC, bets against stocks he sees as overvalued and buys those he deems cheap. Reflecting the extreme disconnect between those parts of the market, he said, the stocks he is betting against, or shorting, have an average forward P/E ratio of about 210 times, versus the 10-times P/E ratio of stocks he is betting on.
"The high-growth, high-momentum stocks are more overvalued than
and
and
and things like that were in 1999," he said. "The value part of the market is far cheaper now than it was in 1999 as well."

  Asian Morning Briefing: Stocks End Mostly Higher

MARKETS AT A GLANCE
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT:
U.S. stocks ended mostly higher, but technology shares extended recent declines. Treasury bonds strengthened, the dollar ticked higher and gold prices fell after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen signaled that a hike in interest rates remains far off. Oil futures climbed to a one-week high after a report showed an unexpected drop in crude-oil supplies.
OPENING CALL:
Investors will be watching China's April trade data, following an unexpected drop in both exports and imports in March that threw doubt about the country's growth prospects. The new export orders subcomponent of HSBC's flash PMI fell below 50, indicating a contraction and providing more evidence of weak global demand for China's exports. But some economists say the slip in the trade data is difficult to interpret, because exports were exaggerated in early 2013 as companies disguised investment funds as trade payments to skirt China's limits on moving money across its borders.
EQUITIES:
U.S. stocks ended mostly higher, but technology shares trading at pricey valuations continued their recent declines.
Consumer Internet stocks weighed on the Nasdaq. The Global X Social Media Index exchange-traded fund, which tracks social-media stocks, lost 2.7%.
Twitter Inc. fell 3.7%. The stock posted its second-biggest drop ever Tuesday after some shareholders got their first chance to sell their shares.
Even after the recent losses, Twitter is trading at 275 times its expected earnings for the next year, according to FactSet.
The Russell 1000 Growth Index, which tracks large stocks with high forecasts for profit growth, edged up 0.2%, while the Russell 1000 Value Index, which tracks large stocks seen as bargains, rose 0.8%. Value stocks are up 3.1% so far this year, well outpacing the 0.3% gain in growth stocks.
Among other tech stocks getting hit, Groupon Inc., FireEye Inc., and King Digital Entertainment all dove after reporting earnings. Social-media stocks have been under pressure in recent sessions, and the Global X Social Media Index ETF is now down 23% year-to-date.
The Dow and the S&P 500 rose after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen testified before Congress.
Asian markets were broadly lower Wednesday. Japan's markets reopened after a long holiday weekend, with the Nikkei Stock Average slumping 2.9% with a stronger yen weighing on exporter shares. China's Shanghai Composite dropped 0.9% to snap a four-session win streak.
FOREX:
The dollar edged higher against major currencies after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen gave a mostly upbeat economic outlook, offering no surprises for investors.
Despite her overall positive assessment of the U.S. economy, Ms. Yellen's testimony failed to generate any strong gains for the dollar against rivals. Investors' belief that the Fed is no closer to raising interest rates, which would help the currency, likely held back the dollar's appreciation, analysts said.
"There was nothing new from Yellen, so that means status quo for the Fed's outlook for monetary policy," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst in Washington, D.C., at currency brokerage Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc. "We'll need a shift in the market's expectations of Fed policy leading toward a rate hike for the dollar to meaningfully rally."
The New Zealand dollar fell against major currencies after Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler criticized the currency's strength and threatened to intervene and to slow down the pace of interest-rate increases.
BONDS:
Treasury bonds strengthened after the top official at the U.S. central bank signaled that a hike in interest rates remains far off.
The buying was led by shorter-dated bonds whose yields are directly impacted by market expectations regarding the timing for the central bank to raise short-term interest rates.
The five-year note was the best performer, with its price 4/32 higher and the yield sliding to 1.651%.
In her latest testimony before lawmakers Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen largely reiterated her stance over the past few weeks: the U.S. economy is improving from harsh winter weather, yet the pace is not strong enough for the central bank to start raising short-term interest rates any time soon.
Ms. Yellen's latest remarks boosted speculation the first rate hike wouldn't occur until the third quarter of next year. The odds of a rate hike from the Fed's June 2015 meeting fell to 48% from 52% a day earlier, according to data from CME, a major derivative exchange based in the U.S. The odds of a rate hike in July 2015 ticked down to 70% from 72%.
COMMODITIES:
Oil futures climbed to a one-week high after government data showed an unexpected drop in crude-oil supplies.
U.S. oil stocks fell by 1.8 million barrels to 397.6 million barrels last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Analysts had expected stocks to rise by 1.2 million barrels, according to a Wall Street Journal survey, which would have placed inventories at their highest level since the EIA began tracking weekly data in 1982.
Though refinery utilization fell by 0.8 percentage point to 90.2% of capacity, versus expectations that it would rise by 0.4 percentage point, the utilization rate was still the highest for the first week of May since 2006.
Refinery runs have been higher than average in recent weeks amid strong demand for gasoline from U.S. and overseas drivers.
Gold prices fell after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen presented an upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy in her testimony to Congress.
Other precious metals also retreated, with platinum and palladium tumbling as voters in South Africa headed to the polls for the country's general elections.
TODAY'S HEADLINES:

Commentary (U.S.)/By   Joel Kurtzman/May 4, 2014 6:35 p.m. ET/Commentary (U.S.)
              
            

      

    


  

  Getting Depressed About U.S. Success

    I've learned that there's a cloud in every American economic advantage

This is not the right time to be an optimist. In my experience, if you say something good about the long-term prospects of the U.S. economy—especially its potential for growth—it's like you're barking at the moon. I'm finally getting the message. I'm changing my views.
If the U.S. happens to be sitting on the world's largest reserves of energy, which are now reachable thanks to innovative American technology, and if emissions of carbon dioxide are declining because we are shifting away from coal to natural gas, then we should focus instead on studies showing that some old wells, and some types of valves, have been leaking methane. Perhaps 1% of wells in the U.S. are in that situation. So, rather than repair these wells, and replace the valves, we should simply stop hydraulic fracturing—aka "fracking"—which has helped make this energy revolution possible.
The same is true with manufacturing. Even though machinery overseas, and even some entire manufacturing plants are being dismantled, put on ships and sent back to the U.S., we should view signs of an American manufacturing revival realistically. New factories, along with their new, more efficient processes, including the amazing world of 3-D manufacturing, are likely to require employees to have at least a community-college degree to operate. That leaves out some people.
The fact that housing prices have pretty much recovered, means—sadly—some people are again unable to get into the housing market. Other reasons to worry: Pension funds, which have recovered in value to their pre-financial-crisis levels, remain risky and could be poised for another fall. And all of that investible capital sitting on the sidelines in the nation's banks and on deposit with the Federal Reserve—trillions of dollars of capital—could somehow trigger inflation.
There is no end to the power of negativity. For instance, the stunning drop in the U.S. crime rate over the past two decades is nothing to crow about if it meant that the police had to increasingly stop, question and frisk likely suspects. What about education? The math and English scores in many inner-city schools are going up, but too many of those schools are charters with nonunion teachers. And, besides, U.S. schools are still well behind Finland's. And the fact that American consumers have less debt than in the past 35 years—once upon a time that would have been good news, but now it means people are still mistrustful about spending. That's also why savings rates have soared.
We all know that the U.S. recovered from the 2008 financial crisis while Europe is still struggling. Not much we can do about that. But looked at the right way, the Europeans are actually faring better. Their laid-off workers get unemployment insurance that never ends. Our form of capitalism is too cutthroat—it takes Congress to extend unemployment benefits.
And don't get too carried away about American ingenuity. It has made the U.S. the center of the biomedical, robotics, big-data and self-driving-vehicle universe. It has also given America dominance in Internet search, and remarkable products like energy-saving thermostats that can be adjusted remotely with a smartphone. But there's a problem. An awful lot of these advances were made by immigrants who studied at American universities.
Though we've put every obstacle in these people's pathways and tried to discourage them, we can't seem to prevent the most talented of them from staying in the U.S. and starting companies and creating jobs. Four of the six top people who started PayPal are immigrants. Still more immigrants started companies like

YouTube,



Tesla, SpaceX, Yelp, Yammer,
and many others. Good thing U.S. immigration policy prevents more of these folks from coming here.
Being optimistic about the U.S., as I have learned, means you are naïve, simple-minded, even deluded. Being pessimistic means you're worldly, seasoned, even downright smart. Nobody can put anything over on a pessimist. Just ask all those people who sold their stock when the financial crisis hit. They understood that the U.S. would never come back. And, for them, it never did.

  'Amazing Spider-Man 2': Web Juice on Empty

    Spider-Man flies, but without joy

Two years ago, when the "Spider-Man" franchise was rebooted with a new actor in the spandex suit and goggles, "
" defined amazement sharply downward. Still, Spidey remained a brand, if not the stuff of sturdy tentpoles, so there was a commercial argument to be made for "The Amazing Spider-Man 2." Even bad movies can succeed in the international market, where audiences continue to consume action eagerly. How bad is this one, though? Amazingly so. Villainy abounds, but the villains are strident contrivances. Spider-Man flies, but does so dutifully, without joy. (And often without web juice or even webs, which show up willy-nilly.) By the same token, a number of New York City police cruisers perform impressive cartwheels after epic collisions. That, too, is amazing, for sheer repetitiveness. It's like a default setting for the ragged script. When all else fails, cop cars take flight.
The current incumbent of the title role, Andrew Garfield, has an easy charm that the movie sensibly seeks to exploit. "You know what it is I love about being Spider-Man?" says an exuberant Peter Parker early on. "Everything!" Yet Marc Webb's direction is so coarse, and the production's tone is so variable, that the Marvel hero soon comes off as a wise guy, then as bipolar, at the very least. "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" has a surfeit of tortured characters, and Spidey is one of them. Every time he flashes back to his childhood he suffers mortally, though not as much as his old friend Harry Osborn, aka Green Goblin (now played by Dane DeHaan), who suffers hideously from retroviral hyperplasia, the Osborn family's curse. And Harry's suffering is kids' stuff compared to that of Jamie Foxx's doomed Max Dillon, who, transformed into Spidey's adversary Electro, suffers amped-up agonies that Nikola Tesla never dreamed of. (Was it only last month, with "Captain America," that a Marvel movie turned out to be great fun?)
Electro's plight yields the film's best sequence, as well as its worst, and they're one and the same. He's a power junkie, so he goes to blindingly bright Times Square at night for a megawatt fix, and a battle with Spidey ensues. The visuals aren't just spectacular, they're eerily memorable: Electro's blue image fills every Jumbotron from Father Duffy's statue to 42nd Street. Yet the beauty of these digital effects is overwhelmed, and our senses along with it, by the hyperfrenetic pace and the intensity of the audio surround, which booms with Electro's paranoid ravings. The movie's curse is a head-banging gigantism that crushes any semblance of humanity.
Many such semblances pop up in the screenplay that's been pasted together by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Jeff Pinkner, but there are few traces of inner life. Sally Field's Aunt May has become an embarrassment; enough, already, of May's maudlin domesticity. Felicity Jones is fleetingly appealing as Felicia, a bright-faced employee of the Osborn empire's OsCorp, but the movie loses track of her all too soon. Then there's the problem of Peter's girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, who wouldn't be a problem if she weren't played by Emma Stone.
That is to say, Ms. Stone is so endearing, and engaging, and all sorts of good things movie stars are supposed to be, that she keeps tempting us to see her character as something more than the silly prop Gwen inevitably is. Yes, this vivacious young woman has something resembling a life, an outer life in which she's about to be graduated from high school (don't bother to do the math; Ms. Stone almost gets away with it), and she goes back and forth with Peter (whom she knows, antidramatically, to be Spider-Man) about whether they have a romantic future. But Gwen has little to do until, absurdly, she gets to save the day by resetting the city's electric grid. This franchise needs more than a reset. It's ripe for retirement.
Pawel Pawlikowski's "Ida," a compact masterpiece set in Poland in the early 1960s, gets to the heart of its matter with startling swiftness.
The film opens in a convent, on the touchingly plain features of a young novice named Anna. As she cleans the face of a statue of Christ with a soft brush, her concentration is complete. Raised in an orphanage from infancy, with no knowledge of her past, Anna (played exquisitely well by a first-time actress, Agata Trzebuchowska) is a week away from taking her vows. Suddenly, though, she is stunned to learn from the Mother Superior that she has an aunt named Wanda Gruz. "You should meet her before you take your vows," the Mother Superior says. "She is your only living relative." Then the one thunderclap is followed by another. Moments after meeting her niece, Wanda (a remarkable performance by Agata Kulesza) observes coolly, almost sardonically, "So you're a Jewish nun."
Anna's real name, her aunt tells her, is Ida Lebenstein, and her Jewish parents perished during the darkest days of World War II. Thus do the two women, one as angry as the other was previously serene, begin an exploration of family history—who killed Ida's parents? where are they buried?—of national history and, before and after everything else, of the nature of faith.
Such a revelation near the start of a relatively short narrative—the running time is 80 minutes—might seem to risk diminishing dramatic impact, rather than heightening it. But it's only a catalyst for the journey to come. Or the journeys, concrete as well as spiritual, since Mr. Pawlikowski, who wrote the screenplay with Rebecca Lenkiewicz, takes us on a road trip like no other—bleak horrors intertwined with quiet pleasures—in a film that looks like no other.
First you're enthralled by the look, which invites intense seeing with almost every gorgeous shot. The images are black-and-white, soft and supple, stripped of all clutter, and contained within a frame that's almost square—as if some early filmmaker like the great Danish director Carl Dreyer had pioneered some precursor of Instagram. (The film was shot digitally by Ryszard Lenczewski and Lukasz Zal.) More striking still, much of the life of the film unfolds near the bottom of the frame. It's an unusual aesthetic, but a fascinating one that emphasizes the physical spaces people live in.
Then you're caught up in the heroine's fate. As someone who has lived her whole short life in a sheltered space, Anna, née Ida, may well be terrified by what she's been told, but she is determined to learn everything she can about her lost family in the company of her aunt, who has lost her own way quite spectacularly. Once a passionate Marxist, and a famously ruthless state prosecutor, Wanda is now a lush and a self-loathing wanton. Still, she continues to wield shaky influence as a provincial judge, and she wants Ida to have at least a taste of life—and carnal love—before taking her final vows. "Your Jesus didn't stay in a cave," Wanda tells her. "He went out into the world." Whether Ida will stay out in the world or return to being Anna is the most obvious question the story poses, but far from the only one. For Wanda as well as for her newly beloved niece, the world is seductive and appalling in equal measure.
Andrew Garfield gives a phenomenal performance as a young Englishman who calls himself Jack Burridge. In fact, Jack was the infamous Boy A, convicted of murdering a child when he himself was no more than a child. Now, released from juvenile prison, he's told by his devoted caseworker, Terry (Peter Mullan), that the past is moot and the present is all that matters. But the story makes the opposite case. The young man's past is always with him; the question is whether it will overwhelm him. John Crowley directed, brilliantly.
The movie that made Emma Stone a star. The last time I recommended it was two years ago, and I did so for the same reason I'm plugging it now—because this wonderful comedienne was so shamefully wasted by "The Amazing Spider-Man." She plays Olive Penderghast, an Ojai, Calif., high-school student who goes to class in a bustier emblazoned with the scarlet A of an adulteress. How she reaches this point is a convoluted story, and a hilarious one. Suffice it to say that Olive identifies intensely with Hester Prynne, the outcast heroine of "The Scarlet Letter."
Since Felicity Jones gets such short shrift in "The Amazing Spider-Man 2," here's a plug for her too. In Drake Doremus's wise and beautiful little film, she is Anna, a vivacious young Englishwoman in her senior year at a California college. Anna falls in love with Jacob (Anton Yelchin), a touchingly tender young American. The outward impediment to their romance is bureaucratic; Anna overstays her student visa by a couple of months. But her offense, and the complications that ensue, are only pretexts for a heartbreaking study of lovers falling from a state of grace.

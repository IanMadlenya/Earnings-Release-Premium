  Asian Morning Briefing: Dow, S&P 500 Rise to Records

(MARKETS AT A GLANCE)
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT:
Stocks traded mostly higher and Treasury bonds pulled back after U.S. midterm election results and strong employment data. Gold prices slid and the dollar hit nearly a seven-year high against the yen. Oil futures ended higher after inventory data showed a smaller-than-expected increase in supplies.
OPENING CALL:
The Bank of Japan releases the minutes of its October policy meeting Thursday. The minutes could shed some light on how Governor Kuroda convinced his fellow board members to take the drastic and little expected step of increasing its asset purchases at last week’s meeting. Australia’s monthly employment report is also due to be released. The Australian Bureau of Statistics earlier this week revised September’s jobless number to 6.2% from the previously reported 6.1% figure.
EQUITIES:
The Dow industrials and the S&P 500 rose to records, getting a lift from the conclusion of the midterm elections and a rebound in oil prices.
Investors bought shares in companies with strong earnings and in sectors that might benefit from the U.S. midterm election results, such as medical technology, according to Doug Crofton, head of U.S. cash equity trading at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Generally upbeat corporate earnings in the third quarter and improving U.S. economic data have helped stocks rise to records after their sharp pullback in late September and early October. That pullback was sparked by poor international economic data, especially in Europe, which added to fears about slowing global growth. The speed of the recovery in stocks has been notable; the Dow has gained 8.5% in the roughly three weeks since its Oct. 16 low.
“In the face of these global growth worries, the earnings still came through quite well and that’s been a great shot in the arm for a nice market snapback,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management.
Republicans took control of Congress in Tuesday’s elections. Republicans are seen as being pro-business, said Karyn Cavanaugh, a senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management. But she cautioned against drawing a line between the Republicans’ election win and lasting stock-market gains.
“It’s a temporary Washington boost,” said Ms. Cavanaugh. “The economic landscape and corporate earnings are really what drive markets,” she added.
In earnings news, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. said its third-quarter profit rose 11% as revenue gained across all of its segments. The company projected per-share earnings of $2.57 for the full year, above its prior forecast of $2.54. Shares rose 8.1%.
Time Warner Inc. lifted its earnings outlook as the company’s revenue rose more than expected in the third quarter. Shares rose 4%.
TripAdvisor Inc. shares slumped 14%. The travel portal said third-quarter profit fell as costs and expenses jumped 58% in the period.
Stocks in Tokyo rose for a fifth-straight session Wednesday, while stocks were mostly lower in the rest of Asia
FOREX:
The dollar reached a nearly seven-year high against the yen on expectations of a stronger U.S. economy, buoyed by increases in jobs last month and Republican gains in midterm elections.
Private payrolls in the U.S. rose by 230,000 in October, according to a report by Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody’s Analytics. The number beat forecasts and suggested Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report would also show gains.
In addition, hiring was strong in the U.S. service sector in October. The Institute for Supply Management said the nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index slipped to 57.1 last month from 58.6 in September, below forecasts but still signaling an upward trajectory for an important sector within the labor market.
The reports spurred investors to bet on the dollar with the hope that the Federal Reserve might move up its timeline for raising interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis.
“The Fed emphasized at its most recent meeting it wants the focus of policy to be data-dependent,” said Mark McCormick, currency strategist at Crédit Agricole. “The ADP number came in a little above expectations, which will lead the market to price in a good employment report for October, which helps the dollar.”
BONDS:
Treasury bonds pulled back as an upbeat U.S. employment report and the outcome of U.S. midterm elections encouraged investors to buy riskier assets.
The selling in bonds was cushioned by a separate release showing activities in the service industry pulled back last month.
The more important nonfarm jobs report--which includes both employment in the public and private sectors--is slated for release Friday. The health of the labor market is one of the key factors influencing the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate policy outlook.
The Fed announced an end its monthly bond buying last week and signaled that the timing for the first interest-rate increase depends on how the economy performs. Higher interest rates make newly issued bonds more attractive to buy, thus shrinking the value of existing bonds.
Economists expect the payrolls report to show 233,000 jobs were added last month following a 248,000 increase in September, with the jobless rate holding steady at 5.9%. Economists expect the average hourly wages, a main gauge of wage inflation, to increase by a mild 0.2% last month following no increase in September.
COMMODITIES:
Oil futures snapped a four-session losing streak after a smaller-than-expected increase in U.S. oil supplies and a reduction in Libyan output.
Oil prices have declined steadily for months as growing supplies, particularly in the U.S., and weak demand have weighed on the market. On Tuesday, Brent oil, the global benchmark, fell to a four-year low, and the U.S. benchmark slid to a three-year low.
Inventory data boosted oil prices. Crude-oil stockpiles increased by 460,000 barrels in the week ended Oct. 31, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected stocks to rise by 2.2 million barrels on the week.
In addition, oil officials in Libya said attacks on Western oil fields by local militia forces cut the country’s daily production by about 300,000 barrels a day. Libya has recently been producing over 800,000 barrels a day.
“The inventory report was obviously supportive,” said John Kilduff, founding partner of Again Capital, and “we’re also watching the situation in Libya, which seems to be deteriorating.”
Unless Libyan supply stays offline, though, “I think it’s a one-day bounce,” he said, noting that global supplies remain ample.
Oil prices jumped briefly after rumors circulated on Twitter that a pipeline exploded in Saudi Arabia, raising fears that the country’s crude production and exports could be curtailed. Prices later pared gains.
A diesel pipeline belonging to Saudi Aramco caught fire during construction repairs, but the fire was limited and has been brought under control, a source at the company said. The source didn’t give further details but said the company is expected to issue a statement.
Meanwhile, gasoline stockpiles fell by 1.4 million barrels to 201.8 million barrels, the EIA said. Inventories are at their lowest level since Nov. 16, 2012. Analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted stockpiles would decline by 300,000 barrels.
Gold and silver prices sank to 4-and-a-half-year lows, weighed by a soaring dollar and expectations of more stimulus from the world’s largest economies.

  Alleged Silk Road 2.0 Operator Arrested

    California Man Charged With Starting a Spinoff of Shuttered Online Drug Marketplace

A San Francisco man was arrested Wednesday and charged with operating Silk Road 2.0, a nearly identical version of the Silk Road marketplace
in October 2013.
Blake Benthall, 



       who prosecutors say went by the alias “Defcon,” was charged in New York in a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday for allegedly operating an imitation of the Silk Road website. Prosecutors said his version enabled more than 100,000 people to buy and sell illegal drugs. U.S. authorities shut down Silk Road 2.0, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Thursday.
“Let’s be clear—this Silk Road, in whatever form, is the road to prison,” said Manhattan U.S. Attorney 



      Preet Bharara,
.
Prosecutors said Mr. Benthall secretly owned and operated Silk Road 2.0, which, since its launch in November 2013, has been used by thousands of drug dealers and other vendors to sell illicit goods, as well as to launder millions of dollars generated by the transactions. As of September, Silk Road 2.0 had about 150,000 active users and generated sales of about $8 million a month, the complaint said.
According to the complaint, Mr. Benthall is a bitcoin enthusiast: He posted links and discussions about the digital currency on his
, a social network for software developers. He called himself a “bitcoin dreamer” in his
. And about a month after he allegedly took control of Silk Road 2.0, Mr. Benthall used bitcoin to buy a Tesla Model S vehicle, the complaint said.
Prosecutors, in the complaint, charged Mr. Benthall with one count of conspiring to commit drug trafficking, one count of hacking conspiracy, one count of conspiring to traffic in fake identification documents and one count of money laundering conspiracy.
Daniel Blank, 



       a federal public defender appointed to represent Mr. Benthall when he appeared in San Francisco federal court Thursday, declined to comment.
Silk Road 2.0 was created, the complaint said, in the wake of the U.S. government’s
and the arrest of its alleged administrator, 



      Ross Ulbricht.



       Mr. Ulbricht has
, and his trial is scheduled to begin in January.
The Silk Road, as well as the 2.0 version, operated as an online bazaar for illicit goods, from drugs to fake identification to hacking services, prosecutors say. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents, according to the complaint, used Silk Road 2.0 to purchase heroin, cocaine, acid and oxycodone pills.
At its November 2013 launch, Silk Road 2.0 was controlled by a co-conspirator using Mr. Ulbricht’s alleged alias, Dread Pirate Roberts, with Mr. Benthall operating as a second-in-command, according to the complaint. But by late December 2013, following the arrests of three alleged Silk Road administrators, the unnamed co-conspirator stepped aside and Mr. Benthall, using the name “Defcon,” allegedly took control of the site, and he administered it since that time, it said. The Silk Road 2.0 server was leased by a customer using Mr. Benthall’s email account, the complaint said.
Both the original website and its alleged sequel operated on the Tor network. The login page for Silk Road 2.0 contained an altered image of the seizure notice posted on the original, saying “THIS HIDDEN SITE HAS RISEN AGAIN,” the complaint said.
The new website was designed to be an almost identical version to the original, the complaint said, down to the same logo of a nomad on a camel. Like its predecessor, it also used its own bitcoin-based payment system that used a “tumbler” to
by passing bitcoin through dummy transactions on the Blockchain, a public ledger of all transactions made in bitcoin, the complaint said. Silk Road 2.0, also like the original, charged a commission for every transaction conducted by its users.

  Panasonic Looks to Grow Through Acquisitions, Tie-Ups

    Electronics Giant Shifts Focus to Corporate, Government Clients

TOKYO—Following several years of heavy losses and restructuring that cost thousands of jobs, Japanese electronics giant


now says it is ready to spend more on growth through acquisitions and alliances.
“We will aggressively look for mergers and acquisitions as well as investments in strategic partners,” said Panasonic President 



      Kazuhiro Tsuga



       at a news conference Friday.
Once a household name in consumer electronics world-wide, Panasonic has scaled back its flagship television business and stopped selling smartphones in recent years. Instead, it has been trying to become a different kind of company that earns a big chunk of its revenue from products and services for corporate and government clients.
The Osaka-based company, for example, is supplying electric-car batteries to

and building energy-efficient homes.
Mr. Tsuga said Panasonic is considering setting aside a “significant budget” for M&A purposes. “We have to make timely investments,” or the company will miss opportunities to grow, he said.
In late March, Panasonic set a long-term goal of generating ¥10 trillion ($90 billion) in annual revenue by the year ended March 2019, roughly a 30% increase from the last business year.
“If we just rely on organic growth [of existing businesses], we won’t be able to reach that ¥10 trillion target,” Mr. Tsuga said.
On Friday, Panasonic raised its profit forecasts for the current business year through March, even as it reported a 30% decline in net profit for its second quarter through September. The quarterly profit fell because the year-earlier figure had been padded by one-time gains from stock sales.
For the year through March, Panasonic now expects a net profit of ¥175 billion, higher than its previous forecast of ¥140 billion, on revenue of ¥7.75 trillion.
Upbeat earnings forecasts for the full year are based on a strong sales outlook for solar panels. Even though the market for panels is crowded with low-cost players in China and elsewhere, Mr. Tsuga said Panasonic’s panels are competitive because of the company’s cost-efficient factory in Malaysia.
Panasonic has already announced big investment plans. Earlier this month, Mr. Tsuga said the company would invest tens of billions of yen in Tesla’s lithium-ion battery factory in the U.S. in what would be the first round of investments. In July, Tesla founder 



      Elon Musk



       said he expected the Japanese partner to contribute 30% to 40% of the factory’s total cost, estimated at $5 billion.
To expand its energy-efficient housing business outside Japan, Panasonic is targeting Southeast Asia, trying to sell such homes to wealthy families there.
Still, despite improving forecasts, the company sees room for more restructuring.
“We are still a mixture of businesses that are growing and businesses that need to shrink to do well,” Mr. Tsuga said.
Panasonic is one of several Japanese electronics makers that have recovered from heavy losses through restructuring and strategic change.


, traditionally known as a TV maker, has been playing a bigger role as a supplier of mobile displays for

and other global smartphone brands. On Friday, Sharp said it made a net profit of ¥6.5 billion for the quarter through September, while revenue rose 14% to ¥707.9 billion.

  Tesla Pledges to Boost Output as Loss Widens

    Electric-Car Maker Cites Production Limits in Latest Quarter

Electric car maker


reported a wider third-quarter loss and trimmed its forecast for deliveries this year, citing delays to a planned factory overhaul.
The Palo Alto, Calif., auto maker reported a loss of $74.6 million, compared with a $38.5 million loss a year ago. It also lowered its forecast for full-year deliveries of its Model S sedans by 2,000 vehicles to about 33,000.
Tesla said it earned $3 million, or two cents a share, excluding stock-based compensation, better than the one-cent a share adjusted loss forecast by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Vehicle sales in the third quarter were 7,785, slightly less than the 7,800 forecast by the company.
Revenue nearly doubled to $852 million from $431 million a year earlier.
“Demand is not our issue; production is our issue. And being too perfectionist about future products,” Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       said on a call with investors. He reiterated a goal of being able to make up to 100,000 vehicles by the end of next year, and said the company would spend $350 million in its current quarter to increase capacity.
That reassurance helped push its shares up 7%, or $15.62, in after-hours trading after finishing off $7.96 at $230.97 in 4 p.m.
trading.
Two weeks ago, industry trade publication WardsAuto estimated that Tesla’s U.S. sales for the first nine months this year had fallen by 26%. Mr. Musk disputed it at the time, saying its world-wide sales in September were at a “record high.”
The company continued to reap significant cash from selling emissions credits. In its latest quarter, Tesla said it sold $93 million in credits, which help other auto makers offset sales of gas-hungry vehicles. It also collected $31 million from sales of electric powertrains, mainly to

.
Tesla consumed $304 million in cash—about 10% of its reserves—during the quarter. It expects to sell 2,000 fewer vehicles this year after a plant equipment installation designed to increase production took longer than forecast.
Tesla is investing heavily to expand in markets in Asia and Europe while also developing its coming Model X sport-utility vehicle. Research and development expenses rose 28% in the third quarter compared with the second quarter. Overhead costs rose 18%, and the company spent $284 million on capital expenditures in the latest quarter.
“People don’t appreciate how hard it is to manufacture something. It is really hard. I have great respect for people who manufacture complex objects,” Mr. Musk said, discussing a delay to its Model X. It now plans shipments in the third quarter of 2015, a one-quarter slip.
The company forecast adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of between 30 cents and 35 cents a share. That is less than half the 75 cents a share consensus for the final quarter tallied by Thomson Reuters.
Separately, Tesla was one of four car makers to earn a 5-star rating in the latest set of European crash tests by independent regulators.
, or Euro NCAP, awarded its highest rating to
in a batch of six tests. Cars made by

,

, and

also received five stars, while two others were assigned four.
Achieving five stars from Euro NCAP isn’t uncommon. Eight of the past 20 cars tested received that rank. But the Model S—one of the few cars recently tested by Euro NCAP and sold in the U.S. and Western Europe—is unique in that it also has received a 5-star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the U.S.
“The Model S is one of just a few cars to have ever achieved a 5-star rating from both,” Tesla said in a statement. The company claims it has the only car this year to receive both a five-star Euro NCAP rating and five stars in every NHTSA subcategory, including frontal impact, side impact, and rollover.
The ratings, often viewed by customers as the gold standard of safety analysis, gives Tesla a boost at a time when it is looking to expand globally and establish its legitimacy in an industry dominated by auto making conglomerates with access to billions in capital. The auto maker has one of the few relatively successful fully electric cars on the global market.
It has been gradually rolling out new features and more attractive pricing. For instance, lease rates in the U.S. were recently lowered by as much a 25%, an incentive made possible by its partnership with a lender that has access to lower-cost capital.
While the Model S already has features such as lane-departure warning and speed-limit warnings, more safety enhancements are slated to come. Blind spot warning and collision avoidance are “coming soon,” the auto maker said.

  Elon Musk’s Next Mission: Internet Satellites

    SpaceX, Tesla Founder Explores Venture to Make Lighter, Cheaper Satellites

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk shook up the automotive and aerospace industries with electric cars and cheap rockets. Now, he is focused on satellites, looking at ways to make smaller, less-expensive models that can deliver Internet access across the globe, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Musk is working with 



      Greg Wyler, 



       a satellite-industry veteran and former


executive, these people said. Mr. Wyler founded WorldVu Satellites Ltd., which controls a large block of radio spectrum.
In talks with industry executives, Messrs. Musk and Wyler have discussed launching around 700 satellites, each weighing less than 250 pounds, the people said. That is about half the size of the smallest communications satellites now in commercial use. The satellite constellation would be 10 times the size of the largest current fleet, managed by



To be sure, the venture would face large financial, technical and regulatory hurdles, and industry officials estimate that it would cost $1 billion or more to develop the project. The people familiar with the matter cautioned the venture is in its formative stages, and Mr. Musk’s participation isn’t certain.
Messrs. Musk and Wyler are considering building a factory to make satellites, the people said. One of the people said initial talks have been held with state officials in Florida and Colorado about locating the factory.
In addition to Mr. Musk, WorldVu is seeking a satellite industry partner to lend expertise to the project, this person said.
Mr. Musk’s closely held Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, likely would launch the satellites, those people said, though no agreement is in place. SpaceX has launched a dozen of its Falcon 9 rockets in the past five years and plans more than four dozen launches through 2018. In September, the company
to develop, test and fly space taxis to carry U.S. astronauts into orbit.
Building a plant and testing satellites is a lengthy process, and WorldVu needs to clear the use of spectrum with other operators. SpaceX may not have capacity to launch the satellites until the end of the decade, by which time WorldVu risks losing its spectrum.
A previous satellite Internet startup founded by Mr. Wyler, O3b Networks, has faced technical problems with the first four satellites it launched, which likely will shorten their lifespans. Today, O3b serves large areas on either side of the equator with a constellation of eight satellites and is planning to launch four more by the end of the year. Mr. Wyler has left the company, though he remains a significant shareholder.
One indicator of the challenge: Mr. Wyler brought a similar plan to Google, which prides itself on tackling big problems. Yet he stayed only about a year
.
Two people familiar with the matter said Mr. Wyler’s relationship with Google soured in part because he wasn’t sure the search giant had sufficient manufacturing expertise.
Google declined to comment.
If Messrs. Musk and Wyler choose to build the satellites, they would face competition from other makers of small satellites, such as Nevada-based Sierra Nevada Corp. and Britain’s Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.
Messrs. Musk and Wyler share an interest in reducing the cost of satellites.
WorldVu needs a lot of satellites, and could be the anchor customer for a high-volume, low-cost satellite maker. Mr. Musk changed the economics of launching rockets by simplifying designs while building engines and other components in-house.
The smallest communications satellites now weigh under 500 pounds and cost several million dollars each. WorldVu hopes to bring the cost of manufacturing smaller models under $1 million, according to two people familiar with its plans.
High costs and limited users have hobbled past efforts to deliver telephone and Internet service from space. Iridium filed for bankruptcy protection nine months after it launched in 1998, after attracting few users willing to pay $3,000 for a phone and up to $7 a minute for calls. Rival Globalstar Inc. sought bankruptcy protection in 2002. Both re-emerged as mobile-data providers.
Messrs. Musk and Wyler also may also be able to find willing investors among technology giants. Both Google and FacebookInc. are working to
to unwired parts of the globe, through drones, balloons and other means.

  U.S. Stocks Rise on ECB Stimulus Hopes

    ECB Signals Readiness For Further Stimulus

Major U.S. stock indexes Thursday climbed to records for the second day in a row, bolstered by rising expectations for more central-bank stimulus in Europe and by upbeat economic data in the U.S.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 69.94 points, or 0.4%, to 17554.47, hitting its 21st record close this year. Year to date, the blue-chip index has gained 5.9%. The S&P 500 also notched another record.
Rising corporate earnings and signs of a steady U.S. economy have lifted stocks this year. But concerns about growth outside the U.S. and the Federal Reserve’s decision last month to halt new bond purchases have tempered investors’ optimism. Last month, the Dow plunged into negative territory for the year on these and other worries.
But European Central Bank President 



      Mario Draghi



       addressed these concerns on Thursday and reiterated the ECB’s unanimous commitment to stimulate growth in the eurozone.

Mr. Draghi gave investors more confidence that the ECB was likely to further expand its balance sheet as the Fed curbs the growth of its own. In October, the ECB moved to stimulate growth and ward off deflation through purchases of specific types of bonds.

Thursday was the second time in the past week that central-bank actions have sent U.S. stocks soaring to record territory. On Friday, stocks rallied after the Bank of Japan made a surprise decision to expand its bond-buying program.
In the U.S., a pair of better-than-expected labor-market reports helped support the gains. The Labor Department reported that jobless claims fell to their second-lowest level this year during the week ended Nov. 1 and that the productivity of U.S. workers rose more than forecast in the third quarter.
The latest jobless-claims data and a strong report on October private-sector job growth released Wednesday have reinforced expectations for the October nonfarm-payrolls report, due out Friday morning. Economists are forecasting 233,000 new jobs, a slight slowdown from the 248,000 in September.

The price of investments that are seen as havens declined. Gold futures lost 0.3% to $1,142.30 a troy ounce, a 4½-year low.

Broadly, earnings have been better than expected, which has helped support stocks’ latest advance. With 436 companies reporting, the S&P 500 is on track for 7.9% earnings growth in the third quarter, compared with the same period in 2013, surpassing analysts’ forecasts of 4.5%.

  Car Makers, Dealers and Consumers

    Tesla is the outfit that is using a direct-sales model that puts them in charge, and the car buyer loses.

Your editorial
(Oct. 25) about Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder outlawing the Tesla direct-sales approach is wrong-way wrong. Dealers create competition and a more favorable car-buying environment for the consumer. Tesla is the outfit that is using a direct-sales model that puts them in charge, and the car buyer loses.




While Elon Musk may be able to retail some high-dollar vehicles to the high-income buyers he is targeting, there are major differences in how Tesla operates that make his operation different from every franchised dealer. Tesla doesn’t appear to take in trades. While the wealthy to whom he caters may be able to buy his product without trading in their current vehicle, average new-vehicle buyers have a trade to dispose of. Therefore, I believe the fears of most franchised dealers are unfounded. As a case in point, in 1998 Ford assembled “collections” of dealerships that they controlled in four metro areas. In August 2001 they announced the end of the experiment.
also announced that it wouldn’t, as previously announced, operate 800 of its own dealerships.
As a franchised dealer in New York, I found it informative to watch the Rochester, New York collection (all eight Ford stores and one Lincoln Mercury) lose market share at an alarming rate, the one measurement you would think they would be able to effect by making sure that they supplied themselves all the “hot” product they needed to make the sales numbers look good. One of the well-known tenets of the automotive business is that the manufacturers are notoriously inept (unprofitable) at running their own dealerships.

  Tesla Posts Wider Net Loss

    Electric Car Maker’s Factory Overhaul Took Longer Than Expected

Electric-car maker


reported a wider third quarter loss and pushed back by a quarter the release of its highly anticipated Model X sport-utility vehicle to the third quarter of next year.
The Palo Alto, Calif., auto maker reported a net loss of $74.6 million, compared with a $38.5 million loss a year ago, as a planned factory overhaul took longer than expected. It also lowered its forecast for full-year deliveries by between 5% and 7% to 33,000 vehicles.
Tesla said it earned $3 million, or 2 cents a share, excluding stock-based compensation, better than the 1-cent a share adjusted loss forecast by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
Revenue nearly doubled to $852 million from $431 a year earlier.
Its shares were up nearly 5%, or $11.34 in after-hours trading after finishing off $7.96 at $230.97 in 4 p.m.
trading.
The company said adjusted results for the fourth quarter were likely to be between 30 cents and 35 cents a share. That forecast is less than half the 75 cents a share consensus for the final quarter.
Tesla trimmed its forecast for 2014 deliveries to 33,000 from 35,000, reflecting lower production capability than it had anticipated. Tesla said it hasn’t changed its forecast for production in 2015, which could reach 2,000 vehicles a week, or close to 100,000 vehicles a year.
Tesla said it delivered 7,785 vehicles around the world in the third quarter, slightly less than the 7,800 it had forecast for the quarter. Tesla has traditionally exceeded its delivery forecast. In this case, Tesla originally planned to deliver 9,500 cars in the third quarter, but lowered the estimate to account for a plant shut down to install new equipment in July. Tesla said the shut down took longer than expected, affecting third-quarter deliveries.
Tesla’s cash pile fell to $2.4 billion from $2.7 billion at the end of second quarter as it invested in capital expenses and lost money from operations.
The company said its revenue included $76 million from sales of zero emission vehicle credits, and $31 million in sales of electric powertrains, mainly to

.
Separately, Tesla was one of four car makers to earn a 5-star rating in the latest set of European crash tests by independent regulators. The European New Car Assessment Program, or Euro NCAP, awarded its highest rating to Tesla’s Model S electric car in a batch of six tests. Cars made by

, and

also received five stars, while two others were assigned four.

  Tesla Skeptics Make Musk Dyspeptic

    Investors Are Growing Impatient With Progress

chief 



      Elon Musk



       likened a speedier model he unveiled last month to a “personal roller coaster.”
Investors in the electric-car maker know the feeling. Underwhelmed after the hype leading up to the event, they watched the stock drop nearly 13% in the following two trading sessions. Of course, up to that point it had rocketed 70% higher year to date and 660% since the start of 2013.
So, even after taking a bit of air out of the tires, Tesla’s $30 billion market value still seems overinflated.
Wednesday’s third-quarter results may be rockier than usual, though. Mr. Musk rejected a recent report in The Wall Street Journal citing estimates by Ward’s Auto that U.S. deliveries were down by 26% year to date. But the figure he used to refute that was specific to September sales in North America, which he said were up 65% year over year. The company itself declined to comment.
Analysts expect Tesla to log a loss of 34 cents a share in the quarter versus nine cents a year earlier. Tesla is seen reporting its first annual profit next year of $2.01 a share, and roughly doubling that in 2016. On that basis, the company is valued at 118 times and 60 times those years’ respective earnings.
It is 2017 and beyond, when Tesla’s mass-market Tesla 3 is slated to go on sale, that will validate or demolish the investment thesis. The ultimate success of that hinges on the company’s “gigafactory” for batteries being built in Nevada. It will be necessary not only to produce the Tesla 3 but also to make its price low enough.
Skeptics abound on the cost front. While shipments of the luxury Model S still look robust and should quicken as capacity is increased, quibbling over today’s sales is a distraction. The big, round numbers hinge upon how much more efficient batteries can become and how attractive Tesla’s mass-market models may be. The technical aspects, in particular, are open questions.
Mr. Musk’s hyperbole and impatience with unflattering analysis could also sow doubt about his battery plant, which skipped over the names “kilo” and “mega” in orders of magnitude.
If he defies the skeptics, tera, peta, exa, zetta and yotta remain available for bolder ventures. As for now, that mass-market ambition is all talk: Yotta, yotta, yotta.

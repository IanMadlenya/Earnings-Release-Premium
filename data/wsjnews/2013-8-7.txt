  Volt Falls to Electric-Car Price War

    GM Lops $5,000 Off Sticker of 2014 Model; Cheap Gasoline Tethers Sales of Plug-in Cars

cut the starting price of its latest Chevrolet Volt electric car by 13%, expanding a price war among makers of plug-in vehicles in response to sluggish demand.
The price cut is yet another sign of the difficulties GM has faced trying to establish a market for plug-ins. Overall, plug-in vehicle sales are rising, driven by offerings such as the Tesla Model S from startup


But despite government subsidies, they remain a niche market.
Limited driving range is an obstacle for most all-electric cars. Volt, which uses a gasoline motor to extend its range to 380 miles, has to compete with fuel- efficient Chevrolets that sell for as little as half its sticker price.
Auto makers are under pressure to sell more electric cars in California, which has quotas for zero emission vehicle sales, and are offering lease deals as low as $199 a month. For some consumers the low-cost leases make driving the cars almost free once government subsidies and fuel savings are combined.
The sticker price on the lowest-cost 2014 Volt will fall to $35,000 from $40,000 and could cost as little as $27,500 after federal tax incentives, GM said on Monday. Consumers will be able to lease the 2014 Volt for as low as $299 a month.
The company has about 105 days' worth of older-model Volts on dealer lots at the end of July.
Auto makers sold about 7,442 battery-powered and plug-in hybrid vehicles in July, according to data compiled by the Electric Drive Transportation Association, a Washington, D.C., industry group. That is less than 1% of light vehicle sales for the month.
Tesla's soaring stock price is more a reflection of enthusiasm for the company's potential than its current sales, which are running at about 1,470 cars a month in the U.S., according to Autodata Corp. Tesla shares rose 4.8% to $144.68 in 4 p.m. New York trading on Monday. Volkswagen AG's Porsche brand—to which Tesla is sometimes compared—sold 3,820 sports cars and high performance sport-utility vehicles in the U.S. in July.
GM's price cut follows similar moves by

and

Ford last month dropped the sticker price of its all-electric 2014 Focus compact to $35,200, a $4,000 reduction. Nissan, earlier this year, slashed the price of its 2013 model Leaf by $6,400 to $28,800.
also cut the monthly lease on a Fit EV to $259 from $389 in June. On Tuesday,
cut the three-year lease on the electric version of its Smart car to $139 a month from $199 a month.
GM sold 1,788 Volts in July—down 3% from a year ago, despite offering up to $5,000 off 2012 models and $4,000 off 2013 models last month. The number of Volts GM sold last month was less than the average sales of its large pickups in a single day.
Nissan sold 1,863 Leafs, nearly five times as many as a year ago, reflecting the company's move within the past year to start production of the car at a U.S. factory. Nissan has capacity at a battery factory in Smyrna, Tenn. to build up to 200,000 Leaf battery packs a year.
GM says the Volt's higher sticker price on entry models had knocked it out of contention on shopping websites such as Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds.com, where consumers can easily compare list prices among competing cars.
Reducing the cost to build the vehicle also helped GM cut the car's price tag, GM U.S. vice president of Chevrolet sales and service 



      Don Johnson



       said. GM Chief Executive 



      Dan Akerson



       said earlier this year manufacturing changes would reduce its cost to build the 2014 Volt by between $7,000 and $10,000.
"We have made great strides in reducing costs as we gain experience with electric vehicles and their components," Mr. Johnson said. "We want to pass those cost savings back to consumers and we have done that with the 2014 model."
Volt has occupied a key role in the debate over government efforts to promote plug-in vehicles since 2010, when President Barack Obama slipped behind the wheel of a Volt and drove it about 10 feet during a plant tour.
Mr. Obama endorsed the Volt as part of a broad effort to put 1 million "advanced technology" vehicles on the road by 2015, spurred by federal investments in plug-in vehicle manufacturers and battery makers. Some of those investments, such as a federal loan to Fisker Automotive Inc. and grants to battery maker A123 Systems Inc. went sour when demand proved weaker than either had anticipated.
GM has had to scale back its ambitions for the Volt. Two years ago, GM forecast it would build 60,000 Volts in 2012. But the company sold only 23,461 Volts last year. Through the end of July, the auto maker has sold 11,642 Volts, up 9.2% from the same period last year.
"Demand for electric cars will continue to remain weak especially when you have gas selling for $3.60 to $3.75 a gallon, and ongoing improvements in fuel efficiency," says 



      Tom Libby, 



       an analyst with R.L. Polk & Co., a subsidiary of


Price cuts on new plug-in vehicles are helping to depress the values of such cars as they age, said 



      Laurence Dixon, 



       a senior automotive analyst at the National Automobile Dealers Association.
The trade-in value of a 2012 Nissan Leaf today is 24.5% lower than the trade-in value of a 2011 Leaf was a year ago, he said. A one-year-old Volt also is worth 21% less now than a one-year-old Volt was at this time a year ago, Mr. Dixon said.
"The incentives the manufacturers have put on these vehicles are extremely high," Mr. Dixon says. Factoring in the federal tax credit puts additional pressure on trade-in values, he said.
In comparison, trade-in prices for used large pickup trucks, such as a Ford F-150 or Chevrolet Silverado, are up about 8% compared with similar age and model vehicles a year ago, he said.

  Stocks Snap Losing Streak

    Dow Breaks a 3-Session Slide After Strong Jobs Data

Stocks advanced, rebounding from a three-session slide, following strong readings on U.S. jobless claims and demand for China's exports.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 27.65 points, or 0.2%, to 15498.32, reclaiming positive territory after spending much of Thursday morning in the red. The S&P 500 rose 6.57 points, or 0.4%, to 1697.48. Both benchmarks notched gains for the first time this week. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 15.12 points, or 0.4%, to 3669.12.
A pair of the year's highflying stocks climbed after posting strong earnings reports.

surged $1.88, or 22%, to $10.60 after revenue improved at the deals website and the company announced plans to repurchase $300 million in stock over the next two years. Groupon's stock price has more than doubled in 2013.

jumped 19.25, or 14%, to 153.48—an all-time high—after the luxury electric-car maker's quarterly loss narrowed sharply, and the company said it delivered more vehicles than expected. Tesla's stock has more than quadrupled this year.
Materials-sector stocks, among the year's worst performers, climbed most after China's July trade data suggested modest expansion of factory activity. Among the strongest performers were coal and iron-ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources, which climbed 1.80, or 8.9%, to 22.01.
Helping stocks was a Labor Department report that showed initial jobless claims rose less than expected in the most recent week. The report dropped the four-week average of claims, a fuller view of the layoff data, to the lowest level since 2007.
"The recovery is what it has been, slow and steady," 



      Tim Holland, 



       partner and portfolio manager at Tamro Capital Partners. Mr. Holland said he has been combing through the winners and losers of the recent earnings season to find stocks to buy.
Stock benchmarks this week have been pinned down by concerns that the Federal Reserve will ease back from its monthly bond-buying as soon as next month. The program has driven bond yields lower and helped support the rally in stocks. But with the S&P 500 up 19% this year through Thursday, traders said market participants are evaluating their next moves.
Tobias Levkovich, 



       chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup, said he is wary of some clients' optimism for a continued stock rally through the end of 2013. After robust gains, he said, investors should be prepared for stocks to drop in coming months.
"I'm hesitant to chase the tape," Mr. Levkovich said. "I see the potential for a pullback, and as the market continues to trade up, the potential for a correction is a bit bigger."
Traders said the focus remains on the potential for changes to Fed policy next month. "You get this sense that the market's collective wish is to just sort of stand still for the next four weeks," said 



      Gordon Charlop, 



       managing director at Rosenblatt Securities.
The Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.6%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed up 0.3%, and the Shanghai Composite fell 0.1%.
The Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.5%. Germany's DAX climbed 0.7%, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes declined to 2.586%. Gold futures rose 1.9% to settle at $1,310.70 a troy ounce, while crude-oil futures fell 0.9% to settles at $103.40. The dollar lost ground against the euro and yen.

  Green Mountain's Buzz Poised to Wear Off

    The Coffee Company's Shares Have Had an Epic Comeback, but the Question Is How Much That Reflects Fundamentals

High praise has a way of preceding big stumbles.
In earlier, headier times,

machines were occasionally referred to as the iPods of coffee. Then, in the fall of 2011, questions about its growth prospects sent its shares tumbling from nearly $116 to less than $18 by the next summer. Like Apple Inc.'s music players, competition and the onward march of technology was to blame.
But the coffee company's shares have had an epic comeback, rallying 276% in the past year to $81.32 a share. The question is how much that reflects fundamentals and how much the wild rally of recently maligned companies. Other "battleground stocks" such as

and

are up by 350% and 412%, respectively, over the same period.

, pilloried by short sellers late last year, is up by 164% since January.
Even if Green Mountain's fiscal third-quarter earnings, due to be released Wednesday, meet expectations, the rally could sputter. Earnings per share are seen at 73 cents, against 46 cents a year earlier. But the figures of most concern are 5,325,765 and 5,840,189. Those are the two key patent numbers for its K-Cup technology that expired last September, allowing competitors to make pods for its Keurig machines.
Earnings expectations fell through the spring but have since recovered as the loss of those patents initially proved inconsequential. Now, though, rivals may be gaining momentum. Green Mountain estimated late last year that unlicensed K-Cups would be about 5% of the market this year, rising to 15% by 2014 to 2015. Independent market research has since put that share near the high end of that range.
While Green Mountain's share of it may be smaller, the K-Cup pie is still rising. Some 90 million U.S. households have coffee machines, and Green Mountain estimates its line will be in 16 million to 17 million of them by the end of this year.
Of course, industry growth doesn't have to proceed at the same pace as profits. Fat margins—Green Mountain is still more profitable on an operating basis than Starbucks Corp.—attract copycats. Now trading at 27 times this year's projected earnings, Green Mountain's valuation doesn't fully reflect that threat.
Investors may want switch to decaf.

  Elon Musk's Hyperloop: San Francisco to Los Angeles in 30 Minutes?

    Billionaire Inventor Unveils Plans for Futuristic Solar-Powered Vehicle

SAN FRANCISCO—Billionaire inventor 



      Elon Musk



       unveiled plans Monday for what he has dubbed the Hyperloop, a futuristic solar-powered vehicle that promises to zip people between cities at near sonic speeds.
Whether one ever gets built is a separate question.
In a first draft of his plan posted online, 42-year-old Mr. Musk outlined how such a high-speed service could work. Unlike traditional trains, the Hyperloop would feature a tube suspended aboveground on top of pylons. Inside the tube, pods with electric compressor fans would move back and forth in a low pressure environment, gliding atop a cushion of air. Mr. Musk said he was interested in building a prototype.
See sketches of the first draft of Mr. Musk's high-speed vision.
In layman's terms, Mr. Musk has described his designs as equal parts Concorde, rail gun and air hockey table. He estimates a California Hyperloop, which could travel between San Francisco and Los Angeles in 30 minutes, would cost about $6 billion to $10 billion to build.


Mr. Musk, often called Silicon Valley's real-life version of superhero inventor 



      Tony Stark, 



       is known for tackling pie-in-the-sky ideas. After working at PayPal, the online payments pioneer, he founded electric car maker

and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, the first private company to dock at the international space station.
Although Mr. Musk, who pulled all-nighters drafting the Hyperloop plan, said he didn't want to start another company, he said he was committed to the idea and willing to build a prototype. Mr. Musk said engineers from Tesla and SpaceX helped design the initial draft for the Hyperloop.
"I'm somewhat tempted to make at least a demonstration prototype," said Mr. Musk during a conference call on Monday. "I've come around on my thinking here, maybe I could just do the beginning bit."
He estimates that he could build a prototype in three to four years.
Mr. Musk's plans call for a pair of steel tubes running side by side on elevated pylons. Inside the tubes, air compressors would create a low-pressure environment, though not a vacuum, which would be harder to maintain over long distances.
Inside the tubes, capsules would be propelled forward by an electric induction motor, Mr. Musk said, an invention he said dated to the days of electricity pioneer 



      Nikola Tesla.



       In his system, electric pulses travel the length of the tubes; a magnetized blade on the base of each pod would be propelled forward by the pulses of energy, which Mr. Musk said could come from solar panels on the tops of the tubes.
Pods would travel at about 760 miles an hour. He said it is ideal for cities less than 900 miles apart; for further distances, supersonic planes are more efficient, he said.
Some transportation experts have reacted with skepticism to the Hyperloop hype.
"The possibility of this going mainstream is likely low due to the need for costly greenfield infrastructure," said 



      Richard Barone, 



       the director of transportation programs at the Regional Plan Association in New York. Similar concepts have emerged over recent decades, Mr. Barone said, citing examples including magnetic levitation trains.
Technologies like high-speed versions of conventional train systems "tend to be more successful, because they build off or enhance existing infrastructure," Mr. Barone said in an email message. A technology like the hyperloop could also be a tough fit in a built-up region because of the need to locate the tubes and pylons, he said.
In a conference call, Mr. Musk said the hyperloop would require significantly less right of way than a high-speed rail system in California that will soon begin construction—and cost less money.
In a document depicting the system, Mr. Musk said the system could largely track the route of Interstate 5, traveling in the median to cut down on property acquisition costs. "This is designed to be super-light, and trains are extremely heavy," Mr. Musk said.
The California High-Speed Rail Authority is at work on a planned 520-mile high speed train network linking San Francisco and Los Angeles. The network is projected to eventually grow to 800 miles, stretching from San Diego north to Sacramento by 2029.
That network would move trains at speeds of more than 200 miles an hour, far faster than any other trains in operation in the U.S., and would move passengers from Los Angeles to the San Francisco Bay area in less than three hours, the authority says. But the project, at a projected $68.4 billion, would be one of the most expensive transportation infrastructure projects in the country's history, a Government Accountability Office report said in March.

  Red Hot Noodles Marks Resurgent IPOs

The pasta definitely is boiling.
Until a few days ago,

& Co. had the distinction of being this year's hottest U.S. initial public offering. The restaurant chain's 104% first-day pop was overtaken last week by

123% first-day gain.
Two IPOs doubling on their first day amid record stock prices and easy money raises comparisons with the dot-com boom. So are we partying like it's 1999?
Not even close. According to figures compiled by 



      Jay Ritter, 



       a finance professor at the University of Florida, there were 117 IPOs that returned more than 100% on their debuts that year, the most of the technology bubble. By contrast, there were only 10 such offerings in the 15 years through 1994, before the start of the dot-com mania.
Investors' enthusiasm for new deals definitely is on the rise, though. Between late 2006 and 2012, there had been only four other stocks that doubled on their first trading day. Also, the most-recent quarter had the highest number of offerings since late 2006. Finally, the torrid performance of stocks such as

and

with their widely questioned business models suggests market frothiness.
Noodles will report its first quarterly results as a public company on Thursday, but they won't do much to justify its gains. The earnings forecast of 11 cents a share for the second quarter has come down by one cent since the offering, even as the stock has appreciated 150%.
And it isn't as if Noodles was thrown into the market for a pittance: Its $18 offering price valued it at 45 times the consensus earnings estimate for 2013. Competitors in the fast-casual food arena such as

and

trade at 38 and 25 times, respectively.
Noodles now carries a far headier multiple of 112 times. Is that ominous? A study by author 



      David Dreman



       of IPOs from 1997 through 2000 showed the average offering of that period peaked soon after and fell 97% from its peak once the tech bubble had burst.
But restaurants are more tangible than dot-coms and can grow into their prices. In fact, Chipotle was the next-to-last stock to double on its IPO before the crisis. Since then, it has returned some 860%.

  Tesla Investors Look Far Into the Future to Price Its Shares

Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       doesn't run his Silicon Valley electric car maker by traditional auto industry rules, and investors are so far rewarding him by putting a value on the company that defies easy comparisons.
Tesla is scheduled to report second quarter results on Wednesday, and most analysts are forecasting a 17-cent-a-share loss. In an industry where strategy is driven by the quest for economies of scale, Tesla is tiny. It delivered just 1,400 Model S electric sedans in July, according to researcher Autodata Corp., or about 1% of


U.S. sales for the month.
Yet Tesla's share price has more than quadrupled in the past year, to $142.15 on Tuesday and giving it a market value of about $17.15 billion, a quarter of Ford's, and about 70% more than Fiat SpA—majority owner of Chrysler Group LLC.
Despite its small size, the Palo Alto, Calif., company has become among the auto industry's most closely followed.
CEO 



      Dan Akerson



       recently ordered a team of GM employees to study Tesla and the ways that it could challenge the established auto industry business model.
Even Wall Street analysts who are enthusiastic about Tesla's prospects have put target prices on the company's shares that are much lower than their current market price.
A Tesla spokesman wouldn't comment on the stock price on Tuesday ahead of disclosing June quarter results on Wednesday. But Mr. Musk and other company officials have said in the past that they foresee a Tesla that is building 400,000 or 500,000 cars a year, and can achieve a market capitalization of as much as $43 billion by 2022. That is the level at which Mr. Musk can collect a chunk of stock under a multi-step compensation plan adopted by Tesla's board last year.
Most car companies are judged on the results they can deliver in the near term. Tesla investors are buying on results that probably won't exist until sometime in the next decade. And even that is only if it can deliver flawless manufacturing execution, continued annual growth and crack through the consumer concerns about driving range and upfront costs that have restrained demand for all-electric vehicles so far.
Analysts are expecting the company to lose 68 cents a share this year and earn 50 cents a share next year, according to Zacks Investment Research. By that 2014 projection, its forward price/earnings ratio is 289, compared with Ford's PE of just under 10 and


P/E of less than 1, both based on 2014 earnings projections, according to Zacks.
Tesla's P/E ratio is more akin to Internet stocks than car makers. Supporters say that is because the company's electric vehicle sales strategy is disruptive and the auto maker possesses groundbreaking technologies.
Deutsche Bank recently raised its target price for the company's shares to $160. The bank estimates that Tesla will be able to achieve operating profit margins of 20%—or about twice that of


in its most recent quarter—as it ramps up sales and spreads costs over a larger number of vehicles.
"We expect [Tesla] to reach at least 200,000 units by near the end of the decade, which implies about 5% of what we calculate as the addressable market of comparable vehicles in terms of capability and price," the bank said in a note to investors last month.
Tesla sold 8,931 vehicles this year through June, according to Autodata. In contrast, Porsche delivered 81,565 of its big ticket and high margin vehicles globally during the same period.
Mr. Musk has said he believes Tesla can achieve 25% gross margins by the end of this year, meaning that Tesla's direct costs of building cars will be just three-quarters of the revenue it collects from sales. In the first quarter, Tesla's gross margin was 17% of sales.
Wall Street analysts assume that Tesla will sell around 100,000 of the company's "Gen 3" models—electric sedans that are expected to start at about $35,000 when available in late 2016. Investors are counting on Tesla being able to deliver a car that competes against luxury sports cars such as the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4—and not similarly-priced electric cars.
The hurdles are many. Other manufacturers now offering electric cars for under $40,000 have so far failed to generate much volume. The Nissan Leaf, which starts at about $28,800, is on a pace to sell fewer than 50,000 cars this year on a global basis.
Established luxury brands also are planning to challenge Tesla with plug-in models of their own, such as the BMW i3 and a Cadillac ELR plug-in hybrid coming from GM.
Many analysts say the shares currently are overpriced based on their sales and profit projections. 



      Adam Jonas, 



       a Morgan Stanley analyst, says Tesla's shares should be trading at about $109. His estimate assumes Tesla continues to expand its business 15 years into the future to get to his stock value—which is about 23% less than its current price.
Mr. Jonas assumes Tesla eventually can sell more than 200,000 vehicles a year at an average price of $50,000, with the majority of the sales coming from the company's Gen 3 models. This year, Tesla is expected to deliver about 20,000 Model S vehicles.
"We argue that Tesla cannot be valued on traditional near-term multiple metrics like traditional auto companies," Mr. Jonas said.
Goldman Sachs analyst 



      Patrick Archambault



       has one of the lower stock price estimates at $84 a share. He estimated Tesla will be making about 150,000 vehicles a year and earning about $1.1 billion, or $8.59 a share, in 2018.
Barclays senior analyst 



      Brian Johnson



       is pegging Tesla at $90 a share. He thinks that Tesla, at a minimum, can sell about 50,000 Model S and Model X vehicles a year around the globe, making it is successful "niche luxury car maker." But that should only get Tesla to about $60 a share in value.
To be worth $90 a share, Tesla has to make a credible entry-level luxury car that he thinks will be priced at between $42,000 and $45,000. "They are going to have to do in five years what it took Audi decades to do—break into the volume entry-level luxury market."
Today's stock price, he said, reflects investors who believe Mr. Musk "is the next 



      Henry Ford.



      "

  Elon Musk's Hyperloop Hits Wall of Skepticism

    California Politicians Doubt Prospects of Transportation Concept

Elon Musk's



       Hyperloop sped into a brick wall of political reality Tuesday as California politicians said there was little chance the billionaire inventor's idea for a futuristic transport system would be built soon or on the public's dime.
Instead, lawmakers in Sacramento said they're planning to proceed at pace with plans for their own California high-speed rail that is scheduled to run from San Francisco to Los Angeles by 2029.
Mr. Musk announced the concept on Monday, putting a $6 billion price tag on the transport system that would whisk passenger capsules at high speeds on a cushion of air inside a tube suspended above ground. He said it could transport passengers from San Francisco to Los Angeles in half an hour.
"I think it's a fascinating concept, but there's a long distance between imagination and implementation," said 



      Bonnie Lowenthal, 



       a Democrat who chairs the California State Assembly's Transportation Committee.
"Big infrastructure projects in California are very difficult," Ms. Lowenthal added. "We have very complicated funding, we have environmental protections, seismic faults and land acquisition—but that's just the shortlist."
Some critics of California's existing high-speed rail project, which has taken years to plan and will cost $68 billion, welcomed Mr. Musk's announcement—especially if the project were to be privately funded.
"I think it's a great opportunity for looking at a private-sector solution for more efficient transportation," said 



      Ted Gaines, 



       the Republican vice chair of the state Senate Transportation committee. Mr. Gaines said that he would support the project, but doubted that Democrats would back an alternative to the current plans for high-speed rail.
Dan Richard, 



       chairman of California's high-speed rail authority, suggested that there was more to building a transportation system than just the technology.
"If and when Mr. Musk pursues his Hyperloop technology, we'll be happy to share our experience about what it really takes to build a project in California, across seismic zones, minimizing impacts on farms, businesses and communities and protecting sensitive environmental areas and species," he said.
In a conference call Monday, Mr. Musk said the Hyperloop wouldn't require costly right-of-way acquisitions, a factor in the price of the current high-speed rail project.
The

founder said the system could be built in the median along Interstate 5 to cut down on property acquisition costs. Mr. Musk didn't address how the project would be funded.
In a blog post, Mr. Musk lamented, how could it be that the "home of Silicon Valley" would build "a bullet train that is both one of the most expensive per mile and one of the slowest in the world?"
A spokeswoman for Mr. Musk at Tesla said that "Elon's published document stands alone on this announcement. There is no one available to answer any follow-up questions."

  Freshmen GOP Lawmakers Revel in Maverick Power

ASHLAND, Ky.—U.S. Rep. 



      Thomas Massie



       lives off the electrical grid in a solar-powered home on a 1,200-acre farm in the Appalachian foothills. The first-year congressman and engineering graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built the house from lumber he logged and milled.
The Kentucky Republican also lives off the grid politically. Just a few weeks after his election, he helped spearhead an unsuccessful coup against House Speaker 



      John Boehner



       and has since voted regularly against party priorities.
The defiant posture of Mr. Massie and a dozen or more like-minded conservatives has changed the agenda in Washington. In a capital where partisan power is nearly evenly balanced, he and a small but committed group of new House activists have discovered that they have the ability to block not just Democrats but their own party's leaders—and they are willing to use it.
"I'm going to hang in here like a hair in a biscuit," said Mr. Massie, who has twice appeared on the TV show "Junkyard Wars," as one of the competitors who build machines from scrounged objects. "I'm digging in for the long haul. This place is worse than I thought."
Republicans hold just a 17-vote majority in the House, which means such a relatively small but cohesive bloc can derail just about any measure that doesn't draw Democratic support. That already happened when Mr. Boehner was unable to bring the conservatives into line on a big farm bill, compelling unhappy Republican leaders to make wholesale changes in the legislation. Trouble also lies ahead on a proposed immigration overhaul, as well as efforts to fund the government and extend the U.S. borrowing authority this fall.
Mr. Boehner has told audiences in New York and Washington not to expect much activity from the House for the rest of the year. The speaker was forced to rely on Democrats, for example, to help pass disaster relief for superstorm Sandy, the Violence Against Women Act and an extension of Bush-era tax rates for people who make less than $400,000.
Mr. Massie, 42 years old, represents a potent strain of small-government conservatism. He and his colleagues, unlike some of their predecessors, didn't come to Washington content to trim government. Instead, they believe wide swaths of what government does need to be reconsidered from the ground up to deal with deficits and a potential explosion in entitlement spending,
These lawmakers, who now are the front line of the tea-party movement, are unwilling to fall in line with GOP colleagues. They are, however, willing to vote against what is perceived as their own political interests, as some did in opposing farm subsidies popular back home.
"There are a bunch of zombies here," Mr. Massie said in an interview, referring to lawmakers in both parties. "Most of them come here with the purest of intentions, but they just get bitten…I don't know whether to hug 'em or hit 'em with a baseball bat."
The White House has concluded that this conservative bloc is so formidable that it now is, in effect, seeking to work its agenda through the Senate instead of the House.
Mr. Massie is hard to pigeonhole, though he leans to the libertarian wing of the Republican Party. He drives an $80,000 Tesla electric sedan with a license plate that says, "Friends of Kentucky Coal." He wants lower taxes and less federal spending. He has sponsored or co-sponsored 61 bills, including ones to abolish the Federal Reserve and the new health-care law, as well as a measure to make legal possession of guns in a school zone.
He and his wife, Rhonda, grew up in Lewis County, Ky., population 13,870. They left after high school to attend MIT, where Mr. Massie, with the help of scholarships and financial aid, earned degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering, as well as the prestigious Lemelson-MIT Student Prize, known as the Oscar for inventors.
At MIT, the couple started a company in their apartment to sell a virtual-reality computer technology Mr. Massie created, using some of the 24 patents he developed.
In 2003, after building the company to a 60-person team that raised $30 million from investors, the Massies sold their stake and moved back to Kentucky to raise their four children on the farm where Rhonda Massie grew up. Mr. Massie's father, a beer distributor, and his mother, a nurse, still live in Mr. Massie's childhood home, about 15 miles away in Vanceburg, Ky.
Mr. Massie took a one-week course to learn how to build a timber-framed house on his farm, which he bought from his in-laws. He used a bulldozer to fell the 600 trees he used and assembled the solar electricity system himself. He later acquired 50 head of grass-fed cattle.
Mr. Massie said he began reading the Lewis County Leader, a local newspaper, where he learned county officials had proposed a levy to build a government office to lure a branch of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Mr. Massie, who estimated the levy would have cost him $100, wrote letters to the newspaper and staged a protest that drew 150 opponents. Officials later dropped the idea, and Mr. Massie was soon drawn to politics by the small-government wave that washed across the U.S. in 2010. That year he ran his first political campaign and was voted the top elected official in Lewis County.
As the county's judge-executive, Mr. Massie scoured financial records and halted services he thought the county didn't need. To save money, he installed a new water tank at the county jail himself.
When Mr. Massie ran for Congress in 2012, his maverick reputation had already reached Washington. Majority Whip 



      Kevin McCarthy



       and other House Republicans donated more than $50,000 to Mr. Massie's top rival in the GOP primary, according to the Federal Election Commission.
Mr. Massie used the donations to reinforce his portrayal of his opponent as beholden to Washington. "Once she wore the establishment hat," he said, "it was all over."
He won over college student 



      John Ramsey, 



       who had given $3 million of his inheritance to build a group that backs free-market, small-government conservatives in the mold of former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul. The group, Liberty for All PAC, spent more than $640,000 on Mr. Massie's behalf, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks political donations.
Mr. Massie won the seven-candidate GOP primary with 45% of the vote, and then beat Democrat 



      Bill Adkins



       by nearly 30 percentage points.
House freshmen used to be a quiet breed. But consecutive elections have swept away older lawmakers and replaced them with newer faces, instilling younger members with a measure of power over party elders.
In Washington, Mr. Massie joined a handful of freshmen who won seats despite opposition from congressional Republicans. First-year U.S. Reps. Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma and 



      Ted Yoho



       of Florida both beat incumbent Republicans.
It took Mr. Massie just a few weeks to run afoul of party leaders. In late December, Mr. Boehner was negotiating with President Barack Obama to avoid a combination of pending tax increases and spending cuts that was nicknamed the fiscal cliff. As talks fizzled, Mr. Boehner asked the House to approve extending tax rates for all but million-dollar earners.
Mr. Massie, who was sworn in early after his predecessor resigned, opposed raising tax rates and voted to block it.
Mr. McCarthy, the No. 3 Republican in the House, bounded across the House floor to scold the newcomer, Mr. Massie recalled. Mr. McCarthy then turned to Ohio Rep. 



      Jim Jordan, 



       ringleader of the revolt, and said: "Jim, he doesn't even know what he's doing. He doesn't know what you're getting him into."
After Mr. McCarthy left, other Republicans congratulated the freshman for standing his ground, Mr. Massie said. Mr. Boehner pulled the bill.
Mr. Massie's reputation was cemented weeks later when he tried to deny Mr. Boehner's re-election as speaker. Although the plot fizzled, 12 Republicans voted for someone else or abstained, the most defections by fellow party members for a speaker since 1923.
Mr. Massie and his allies are supported by a network that raises money and builds support outside the party structure. Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and the Heritage Action for America use social media and direct outreach to congressional offices to fan discontent among conservative voters nationwide over legislation they oppose.
"The internal forces here in Washington, D.C., don't produce the right answer," Mr. Massie said. "We need to rally people on the outside."
In March, Mr. Massie and 15 other Republicans nearly upended legislation to fund the government. Some opposed the bill because it failed to cut funds for the health-care law. Others were annoyed that party leaders denied an amendment to prevent Mr. Obama from spending taxpayer money to play golf.
Democrats say the infighting helps them paint the GOP as out of step with voters, while tamping enthusiasm among conservative activists.
"You've got the far right worrying about the far, far right and pulling the entire party out-of-step with independents," said 



      Steve Israel, 



       chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
GOP leaders tried to bring the agitators into the fold. They scored a victory in March by persuading Mr. Bridenstine to support a budget blueprint that Mr. Massie and nine other Republicans opposed.
To win his vote, House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) spent more than an hour with the freshman, trying to quell Mr. Bridenstine's concerns about increased spending. During voting, House Armed Services Chairman 



      Buck McKeon



       (R., Calif.) sat next to Mr. Bridenstine to prevent others from lobbying him against the bill. Mr. Bridenstine said the Ryan plan "was the best we could do" to stabilize the debt.
Republican leaders aren't likely to try a similar effort with Mr. Massie. He told his staff to give his cellphone number only to his most fiscally conservative colleagues. Of Mr. McCarthy, the GOP majority whip, Mr. Massie said, "I run around tying shoes and Kevin runs around untying them."
The rhetoric by House Republicans has cooled since party leaders put off until fall a fight over extending the U.S. borrowing limit. The controversies buffeting Mr. Obama have also galvanized Republicans, including the targeting of conservative groups by the Internal Revenue Service.
"The energy has dissipated some," Mr. Massie said. Party leaders "have succeeded in peeling off some members." He recently attended a session with Mr. Boehner in the speaker's Capitol office. Mr. Boehner told the group to be patient. Change, he said, takes time.
Mr. Massie used the meeting to lobby Mr. Boehner on one of his favorite causes, telling the speaker to oppose legislation that would give states the authority to collect sales tax on Internet transactions. Mr. Boehner told him the bill would never reach the floor, Mr. Massie said.
Representatives of retailers Best Buy, Home Depot, Target and others had piled into Mr. Massie's office in June to give him an earful about how online retailers now have a pricing advantage, according to participants in the talks.
The speaker recently promised his rank-and-file he wouldn't allow a vote on an immigration bill unless a majority of his caucus supported it—a nod to Mr. Massie and others.
Mr. Massie also made a concession to party leaders when he backed a revised farm bill after GOP brass, bowing to conservative pressure, stripped money for food stamps.
But the Kentucky Republican and his allies were back at it last week, nearly passing a measure to defund the National Security Agency's data-collection program.
Back in his district, Mr. Massie revels in his outsider status. He returns to Kentucky on weekends and during the week he stays in the basement of his aunt's house in Virginia.
At a town-hall meeting this spring, he told constituents about a recent flight home from Washington. His 4th congressional district, which is heavily Republican and 92% white, favored former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in the 2012 election by 29%,
The congressman took his seat in the last row of the plane when a man next to him jabbed him in the ribs. "Do you realize who's on this flight," the man said, gesturing to Senate Minority Leader 



      Mitch McConnell



       of Kentucky, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ohio Sen. 



      Rob Portman, 



       all fellow Republicans.
"I was sitting there," Mr. Massie said, "hoping he doesn't ask me what I do for a living."

  Tesla Results Beat Projections, Share Jump

Luxury electric-car maker


reported a net loss for the second quarter, but exceeded Wall Street expectations for production and gross margins, sending its shares higher in after-hours trading.
The Palo Alto, Calif., company posted a $30.5 million loss, or 26 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $105.6 million, or $1 a share. Revenue soared to $405.1 million from $26.7 million a year ago when its $80,000 and up Model S plug-in was just beginning deliveries.
Tesla Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       in a letter to shareholders said that Tesla had a profit of $7 million, or 5 cents a share, when excluding costs associated with stock compensation, early repayment of a federal loan and costs associated with a lease program. Such measures don't conform to generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.
On a GAAP basis, consistent with the way that rival auto makers report results, Tesla said it lost $11.79 million from operations, before interest and taxes, during the just-ended quarter, and burned $78.7 million in cash.
Revenue declined by more than $150 million from the first quarter, mainly because the company deferred some revenue associated with cars delivered under a new financing program designed to mimic a lease.
The purchase/lease financing accounted for 30% of the auto maker's sales in the quarter ended June 30. In addition to the lease change, Tesla received $51 million from selling pollution credits to other auto makers, down from $68 million in the prior quarter.
Tesla said it had cash on hand of $746 million, up from $214 million at the end of the first quarter, reflecting a sale of shares during the quarter.
Model S deliveries increased by 5% from the first quarter to 5,150 cars. Tesla said it began delivering cars to Europe this year and forecast it would produce about 5,000 vehicles in the current quarter. It delivered 89 cars in the year-earlier quarter.
Mr. Musk said during a conference call that its current backlog of Model S orders is averaging about 20,000 in North America on an annual basis. He said based on current reservations abroad that global demand for the model should be about 40,000 a year.
He said the company is working through production constraints that have been caused primarily by suppliers that haven't scaled up enough to meet demand. Mr. Musk said suppliers were following guidance from forecasting firm IHS Automotive that Tesla would sell only 3,000 Model S vehicles in its entire lifetime and didn't build enough capacity to meet current demand.

as they report and compare their results with analysts' estimates. Sort by date and industry.
Lower-cost batteries should enable Tesla to make a profit on a planned lower-cost electric sedan in late 2016, he said. "I have high confidence that we can create a compelling car for around $35,000—compelling being around 200 miles range."
A concern is capacity to produce enough battery cells for the vehicle, he said. "It's really quite a large number to be supplying a factory that is producing say, 400,000 to 500,000 cars."
Shares jumped $17.97, or 13.4%, after finishing down 5.5% at $134.23 in 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Mr. Musk affirmed in his letter to shareholders that Tesla can deliver about 21,000 cars this year and said the company is on track to achieve 25% gross margins for the year, using a non-GAAP calculation. Mr. Musk said during a conference call Tuesday that Tesla's automotive gross margin, revenue received from selling cars minus the direct costs of building them, was 13% in the latest quarter. That figure doesn't include money received from selling pollution credits.
In his shareholder letter, Mr. Musk cited a different non-GAAP gross margin of 22%. That figure included revenue from sales of pollution credits.
Mr. Musk affirmed a forecast for Tesla's non-GAAP gross margin to hit 25% by the fourth quarter, and added, "we are cautiously optimistic that a number above that level may be achievable in future quarters."
Investors are closely following gross margin as a signpost for how well the young company is managing itself. That measure doesn't include the costs of developing new vehicles, marketing or retail and distribution costs.
The letter also said that demand was strong enough that the company bought 31 acres next to its Fremont, Calif., factory for potential expansion. The letter said demand remains strong for the Model S and grew at twice the rate outside of California, its primary market, than in the state.
Tesla has been among the hottest stocks in the U.S. since posting an $11 million net profit in the first quarter of 2013. Investors have gobbled up shares in the company as Mr. Musk has outlined a vision of selling between 400,000 and 500,000 electric vehicles a year, including a sport-utility vehicle and a second, lower priced sedan.

  Tesla Rides Roughshod Over Naysayers

    The Shares Look Extremely Richly Valued, but That Alone Won't Be Enough to Send Them Lower

Did you hear the one about how

shares are overvalued? By this point, everybody has.
After gaining 54% in just two months, Tesla looked ridiculously expensive at the start of May, when it traded at 121 times expected earnings and was worth $6.1 billion. Any valuation-based argument for buying the stock was predicated on the belief that the company would go from selling 20,000 or so electric cars this year to something upward of 400,000 electric cars a year in 2025. At which point, adjusting for wear, tear and wrecks, there would be something close to 1.5 million Teslas on the road.
But after climbing 14% on the back of its second-quarter results late Wednesday, Tesla shares are worth about three times as much as they were in early May. The company, with a market value of $18.7 billion, is worth a bit more than a quarter of

Ford's vehicles aren't as expensive as Teslas, but the company does sell more than five million of them a year.
Nevertheless, betting against Tesla shares remains a dangerous proposition. Just because some investors have become exuberant about a stock, just because it seems beyond richly valued, and just because it has gone up a lot aren't reasons in themselves to bet that it is about to fall.
Think of
some years ago. From the end of November 1998 to early May 1999, the company's shares rose more than 300%—roughly similar to the 345% move Tesla has seen since early March. At its peak in January 2000, Qualcomm shares were 2,514% above their late November 1998 level.
The key to how Tesla shares trade, for now, isn't so much how outsized their valuations seem but how well the company performs compared with expectations. Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk's



       vision of a world where Tesla is producing 400,000 to 500,000 cars a year may seem far-fetched, but so long as it tops sales and margin estimates—as its second-quarter results did handily—the stock market will give him the benefit of the doubt.

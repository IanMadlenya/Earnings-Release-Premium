Tesla Shakes Up Market for Lithium, Other Metals
‘In order to produce half a million cars a year…we would basically need to absorb the entire world’s lithium-ion production,’ Elon Musk said in March

Tesla Motors Inc., shaking up the auto industry with its battery-operated cars, is now reshaping metals markets, too.
Tesla and other electric-vehicle makers are swallowing up lithium, a lightweight material that some call “white petroleum” for its use in lithium-ion batteries that power electric cars.
Lithium carbonate prices rose 47% in the first quarter compared with the average price in 2015, according to the most recent available data from data provider Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. In 2015, when most other metals and commodities still were in the doldrums, lithium prices rose 28%, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said. Orders for the soft metal show no sign of abating. A report from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says lithium demand could triple by 2025 to 570,000 tons, driven principally by smartphone and electric-car applications.
Telsa isn’t the only consumer, but its voracious appetite for lithium is getting significant attention.
The Palo Alto, Calif., company said Wednesday that it expects to sell 500,000 cars world-wide by 2018, and its 2020 production would be one million vehicles, thanks in part to its coming Model 3 car. With a price tag of $35,000, it would be about half the cost of the Tesla Model S sedan. The company says it already has received nearly 400,000 orders for the Model 3.
Those orders will require a lot of lithium.
“In order to produce half a million cars a year…we would basically need to absorb the entire world’s lithium-ion production,” Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said at the unveiling of the Tesla 3 model on March 31.
Tesla also aims to become the world’s largest lithium-ion battery producer with its factory in Sparks, Nev. One Tesla Model S battery contains more lithium than 10,000 smartphones, Goldman Sachs estimates.
While the Earth’s crust contains plenty of lithium, which is the lightest metal on the periodic table, it is difficult to dig up. Most deposits are in remote locations that pose technological and logistical challenges. There are about a half dozen major lithium-producing resource sites world-wide, spread among Chile, Argentina and Australia.
Unlike gold, copper or many other commodities, lithium doesn’t have a spot market and isn’t traded on an exchange. Prices are negotiated individually through contracts between buyers and sellers.
Much of the demand is coming from China, where the government is turning to lithium batteries for use in electric buses and other vehicles. NextEV, a Chinese company that has said it plans to unveil its first electric car next year, could further stoke lithium consumption.
It isn’t just lithium that is experiencing what some analysts call the Tesla effect. Aluminum demand could gain from a development known as lightweighting, or substituting aluminum for steel to create lighter cars such as the all-aluminum body frame in Tesla’s Model S car.
Demand for copper, which is used as a conductor of electricity, also could rise. An electric car uses 60 kilograms of copper per vehicle, four times that of its diesel equivalent, according to producer Mantos Copper.

How Tesla Is Shaking Up Metals Markets
Lithium and copper are among the metals that may benefit from an increase in electric vehicle production
By STEPHANIE YANG
May 5, 2016 10:52 am ET
is starting to shake up the auto industry with its sleek electric cars. Now some say it’s only a matter of time until it helps reshape the metal industry, too. As demand for Tesla’s cars grows, some market participants are starting to anticipate long-term changes in the consumption of metals within the auto industry. The individual metals needed to manufacture an electric car are numerous, but potential beneficiaries range from obscure materials such as lithium to beleaguered commodities like copper.
The extent of Tesla’s impact on metals markets remains largely speculative at this point. Tesla is still a niche car company, not a mass market one.
Tesla is moving to attract mainstream consumers, as it prepares to release its most affordable car yet. The Model 3 has received almost 400,000 reservations since the company began taking deposits on March 31. On Wednesday, the company upped its forecast for delivering 500,000 vehicles globally in a year to 2018, earlier than its previous goal of 2020.
“The narrative is changing,” said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto. “We are headed in the direction where these vehicles are becoming affordable for the mass market. The technology is at a point in time where we could envision this as an ever-increasing factor.”
One metal market is already surging on growing demand from electric vehicles.
Lithium, a key component for the lithium ion batteries used in electric vehicles, has gathered attention from mining companies, investors and the broader public in light of Tesla’s plans to manufacture its own batteries. The average price of lithium jumped 47% in the first quarter of 2016, according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
Tesla’s Gigafactory, which aims to become the world’s largest lithium ion battery producer, has also sparked interest in creating new lithium mines, in order to sustain that production. “In order to produce half a million cars a year… we would basically need to absorb the entire world’s lithium ion production,” Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said at the unveiling of the Tesla 3.

Tesla’s Losses Widen on Lower-Than-Expected Deliveries
Vice presidents for production and manufacturing leave, as auto maker looks to increase output
By Mike Ramsey
Updated May 4, 2016 6:48 p.m. ET
Tesla Motors Inc. said on Wednesday it would ramp up annual production to a half-million vehicles two years earlier than planned, but the electric-car maker will be doing so without two top manufacturing executives.
The Palo Alto, Calif., company nearly doubled its first-quarter loss compared with the same period a year ago, even as sales of its pricey sedan and sport-utility vehicle continued to climb. Tesla abandoned a plan to generate positive cash flow in 2016 as it pours money into its coming Model 3, a $35,000 and up car that it now says will help it sell 500,000 cars by 2018.
The company aims to start churning out Model 3s in the second half of next year. It has a goal of building a total of between 100,000 and 200,000 by year end.
Tesla has struggled to build its current products on time and free of glitches. Problems with the doors and seat latches on the $81,000 and up Model X SUV over the last six months have dented the company’s image.
On Wednesday, Tesla said two high-ranking executives involved with output—Production Vice President Greg Reichow and Manufacturing Vice President Josh Ensign—have already left or will be leaving the company.
Mr. Reichow had been with the car maker since 2011 and had run its powertrain engineering before taking over production. He will stay until a replacement comes on board, Tesla said. Mr. Ensign headed manufacturing and has left the company.
The departures aren’t altogether surprising. Founded in 2003, Tesla has lost a number of executives over the past year as rival electric-car startups and technology companies recruit its employees. Among recent departures: Vice President of Worldwide Finance Michael Zanoni, and Jim Chen, its assistant vice president of regulatory affairs.
“Tesla is going to be hell-bent on becoming the best manufacturer on earth. Thus far, I think we’ve done a good job on design and technology on our products,” Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a conference call with investors on Wednesday. “The key thing we need to do in the future is to also be a leader in manufacturing. It’s a thing we need to obviously solve if we are going to scale and scale rapidly.”
In a letter to shareholders, Mr. Musk reiterated a target of selling between 80,000 and 90,000 vehicles this year. He also said “increasing production five fold over the next two years will be challenging and will likely require some additional capital.”
Wall Street analysts have been closely watching the company’s cash burn, and some have speculated it would need to sell addition shares to finance its production push.
Tesla’s new production goal comes after nearly 400,000 people placed orders for the Model 3, which is projected to go at least 215 miles on a charge. Reservations required $1,000 refundable deposits and produced hundreds of millions of dollars in new funds during the quarter. Those monies helped bolster Tesla’s finances and gave it confidence to pull forward its production plans, officials said.
Mr. Musk, on the call with reporters, estimated Tesla’s 2020 production would be 1 million vehicles. Tesla, however, missed its delivery forecast in its first quarter because of a parts shortage for the Model X and other production issues.
It shipped 14,820 vehicles, fewer than the 16,000 cars it had pledged to deliver. It also borrowed $430 million from its line of credit in the quarter, allowing it to increase its cash balance to $1.44 billion at the end of March.
The company used some of the $1,000 deposits submitted for Model 3 orders to help repay $350 million on its credit line after the quarter ended.
Tesla had promised to start generating cash in 2016, but to ramp up production of the Model 3 more quickly it abandoned that pledge and said its capital spending now may rise to $2.25 billion, up from the $1.5 billion forecast earlier.
Tesla reported a first quarter loss of $283 million, or $2.13 a share, as the lower-than-expected deliveries hurt revenues. On an adjusted basis, Tesla lost 57 cents a share, slightly less than the 58-cent loss average compiled by Thomson Reuters.
Revenue for the quarter rose 22% from a year earlier to $1.15 billion and its gross margin declined, excluding the $57 million it was paid for selling pollution credits to other car makers.
Shares of Tesla rose 3.1% to $229.50 in afterhours trading on Wednesday, after slipping 4.2% at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Tesla Earnings: It’s All About the Dream
Company's earnings came with more ambitious goals, but investors have to stay focused on the fundamentals
By Charley Grant
May 4, 2016 6:16 p.m. ET
Enthusiasm for the Model 3 mass-market car has powered Tesla Motors to lofty heights. But first-quarter results should remind investors that the future isn’t too far away.
Tesla reported revenue of $1.15 billion and an adjusted loss per share of 57 cents Wednesday. That narrowly topped consensus expectations.
But, expectations for the future, rather than current performance, tend to dictate what eventually happens to stock prices. That is especially true for Tesla.
Chief Executive Elon Musk, as usual, made big promises. Tesla now expects to deliver 500,000 vehicles by 2018, two years earlier than the previous goal. And the company affirmed that Model 3 production will begin late next year. This comes after Model 3 preorders exceeded even the most optimistic projections.
More ambitious goals should be great news, but the new plan deserves thorough scrutiny. Meeting production deadlines has never been Tesla’s strong suit. Quality issues have plagued the rollout of the Model X sport-utility vehicle, which came to market years after originally promised. Meanwhile, two senior manufacturing executives are leaving the company.
Mr. Musk also said the new goal “will likely require additional capital.” He added that 2016 capital expenditures will likely be 50% higher than the previous guidance of $1.5 billion. This marks an abrupt reversal, since Tesla said it wouldn’t need to raise additional capital back in February. Tesla’s use of Model 3 deposits to pay down its asset-backed line of credit should also raises eyebrows.
And, as always, at more than 50 times projected 2018 earnings, Tesla shares are priced for perfection.
Hope for a bright future still drives the stock. That hope will be put to the test—and soon.

Options Market Betting on Big Move for Tesla’s Stock
With Tesla earnings looming, traders are betting the shares are about to get a charge
By SAUMYA VAISHAMPAYAN
May 4, 2016 10:50 am ET
The options market is betting on a big move in shares after the company reports first-quarter earnings. The electric-car company is scheduled to post results after the market closes Wednesday. Options traders are betting on a move of 8.7% in either direction through Friday, based on the price of an options strategy called a straddle,according to Trade Alert. A straddle involves buying a call option and a put option at the same strike, near the current price of the stock, in order to bet on the size of the move instead of its direction.
A call option grants the right to buy shares of the underlying stock at a certain price, called the strike, by a specific time. A put option confers the right to sell shares.
If the 8.7% implied move comes on Thursday, the first trading day after Tesla reports, it would be the largest move after earnings since November, when shares jumped 11%. Tesla shares have swung 6.6% on average after earnings in the last eight quarters.
Tesla shares have slipped 3.4% so far this year, through Tuesday’s close, but have surged 61% since their low for the year on Feb. 10.

Tesla Is Heading Straight for a Speed Trap
On the supposed long-term road to success, Tesla bulls face a harsh short-term reality, likely evident in Wednesday’s quarterly results
By Steven Russolillo May 3, 2016 2:04 p.m. ET
For three years and counting, investor enthusiasm for Tesla Motors Inc. TSLA 1.76% has repeatedly overshadowed, well, everything. Profits? Mostly irrelevant. Dwindling cash levels? No problem. Production issues? They won’t happen again, of course.
Tesla’s stock has surged more than 500% since 2013 behind a visionary, albeit unconventional, leader in Elon Musk and a cultlike investor following. But on this supposed long-term road to success, Tesla bulls face a harsh short-term reality.
Tesla has reported years of losses and has burned through billions of dollars. The hope is that the new, shiny and more affordable Model 3, unveiled earlier this year but not expected to ship until late 2017, will reverse those trends.
Until then, quarterly results, including Wednesday’s release, won’t be pretty.

Analysts polled by FactSet estimate Tesla’s first-quarter adjusted loss widened to 60 cents a share from a loss of 36 cents a year earlier. Revenue is expected to have increased by 45% to $1.6 billion. First-quarter deliveries were 1,180 lower than expected because of problems launching the Model X and disappointing Model S sales.
Investors, though, are focused on the Model 3. Mr. Musk said it received 325,000 preorders in the first week alone, which Tesla claimed was “the biggest one-week launch of any product ever.” That has since risen to nearly 400,000.
Yet what gets significantly less attention is Tesla’s underlying financial condition. It burned through $2.9 billion over the past six quarters, ending last year with $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents. That is less than the $1.5 billion in capital expenditures it expects in 2016. Tesla says it won’t need to raise money. Perhaps the $400 million float from Model 3 deposits can help bridge the gap.
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
Analysts don’t expect operating cash flow minus capital expenditures to be positive until 2018 at the soonest. That is despite Tesla touting last quarter a new and more optimistic “core operational cash flow” metric.
Tesla, the company, is disrupting the U.S. auto industry. But Tesla stock, trading at a nosebleed 130 times projected earnings over the next 12 months, looks like an accident waiting to happen.

Tesla Earnings: What to Watch
Silicon Valley electric-car maker’s core business in view after Model 3 rush
By Mike Ramsey
May 2, 2016 11:14 a.m. ET
Tesla Motors Inc.’s TSLA 1.76% first quarter results will be released after the bell on May 4.
EARNINGS FORECAST: Tesla is expected to post an operating loss of 58 cents a share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, compared with a loss of 36 cents a share reported in the first quarter of 2015. Tesla’s first quarter deliveries were 1,180 lower than expected because of problems launching the Model X and sales of the Model S didn’t keep pace with the fourth quarter of 2015. Tesla’s losses have been deepening, and the Silicon Valley electric-car maker has posted only one profitable quarter on the basis of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles since going public in 2010.
REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue is forecast to have risen 45% to $1.6 billion in the first quarter compared with the prior-year quarterly performance. Unit sales rose to 14,820 a 48% increase over the same period a year ago. Deliveries are closely watched given the amount of cash needed to run an auto company and the expectation that more scale will aid Tesla’s business.
WHAT TO WATCH:
MODEL X: Tesla’s annual sales goal of 80,000 to 90,000 for 2016 is among the closest-watched metrics for Chief Executive Elon Musk, and the company’s ability to achieve that rests largely on the status of the Model X. The company recently said it is nearing full production of the new SUV, but it has struggled with parts shortages and customers are reporting numerous repair issues with the vehicle.
CASH: Mr. Musk has said the company will reverse cash outflows in the first quarter of 2016, potentially lessening the need to live on borrowed money. The company ended 2015 with about $1.2 billion in cash, which is less than its annual capital expenditure budget. The larger order bank of reservations for the forthcoming Model 3, representing $400 million in refundable deposits, could give the company a cushion, but investors will be focused on the company’s ability to match spending with income.
MODEL 3: Tesla’s ability to amass about 400,000 reservations at $1,000 per slot has indicated the company will see plenty of demand, but it also raises questions. How many of those deposits were multiple reservations from a single person, for instance? Mr. Musk will also be pressed for details on how quickly the company can ramp up production to satisfy customers—currently the Model 3 is projected to cost about $35,000, have a battery range in excess of 200 miles and go on sale sometime in 2017.
POWERWALL: The company’s stationary battery business made a big splash early in 2015, but focus has largely been on Tesla’s core car business, which sucks up most of the capital. The battery business, by most accounts, is moving along and Tesla should be well on its way to delivering packs around the world. It recently stopped taking orders for its 10 kWh stationary storage device, settling on the 7 kWh model instead due to low demand for the more powerful option.
GIGAFACTORY: Tesla’s giant battery factory near Reno, Nev., is closely watched and the company’s previously-disclosed timetable raises questions. Analysts and investors will look for more insight on whether the plant is ready to produce cells, and whether it on track to make batteries for the Model 3.
